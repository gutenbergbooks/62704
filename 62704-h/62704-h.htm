<h3 class="section nobreak" id="BOOK_XXXII_CHAP_1"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 1. (1.)‚ÄîTHE POWER OF NATURE AS MANIFESTED IN ANTIPATHIES.
THE ECHENE√èS: TWO REMEDIES.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">
Following</span> the proper order of things, we have now arrived
at the culminating point of the wonders manifested to us by
the operations of Nature. And even at the very outset, we
find spontaneously presented to us an incomparable illustration
of her mysterious powers: so much so, in fact, that beyond it
we feel ourselves bound to forbear extending our enquiries,
there being nothing to be found either equal or analogous to an
element in which Nature quite triumphs over herself, and that,
too, in such numberless ways. For what is there more unruly
than the sea, with its winds, its tornadoes, and its tempests?
And yet in what department of her works has Nature been
more seconded by the ingenuity of man, than in this, by his
inventions of sails and of oars? In addition to this, we are
struck with the ineffable might displayed by the Ocean‚Äôs tides,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
as they constantly ebb and flow, and so regulate the currents
of the sea as though they were the waters of one vast river.</p>

<p>And yet all these forces, though acting in unison, and impelling
in the same direction, a single fish, and that of a very
diminutive size‚Äîthe fish known as the ‚Äúechene√Øs‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>‚Äîpossesses
the power of counteracting. Winds may blow and
storms may rage, and yet the echene√Øs controls their fury,
restrains their mighty force, and bids ships stand still in their
career; a result which no cables, no anchors, from their ponderousness
quite incapable of being weighed, could ever have
produced! A fish bridles the impetuous violence of the deep,
and subdues the frantic rage of the universe‚Äîand all this by
no effort of its own, no act of resistance on its part, no act at
all, in fact, but that of adhering to the bark! Trifling as this
object would appear, it suffices to counteract all these forces
combined, and to forbid the ship to pass onward in its way!
Fleets, armed for war, pile up towers and bulwarks on their
decks, in order that, upon the deep even, men may fight from
behind ramparts as it were. But alas for human vanity!‚Äîwhen
their prows, beaked as they are with brass and with
iron,<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and armed for the onset, can thus be arrested and
rivetted to the spot by a little fish, no more than some half
foot in length!</p>

<p>At the battle of Actium, it is said, a fish of this kind stopped
the pr√¶torian ship<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> of Antonius in its course, at the moment that
he was hastening from ship to ship to encourage and exhort his
men, and so compelled him to leave it and go on board another.
Hence it was, that the fleet of C√¶sar gained the advantage<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> in
the onset, and charged with a redoubled impetuosity. In our
own time, too, one of these fish arrested the ship of the Emperor<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
Caius in its course, when he was returning from Astura
to Antium:<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> and thus, as the result proved, did an insignificant
fish give presage of great events; for no sooner had the emperor
returned to Rome than he was pierced by the weapons of
his own soldiers. Nor did this sudden stoppage of the ship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
long remain a mystery, the cause being perceived upon finding
that, out of the whole fleet, the emperor‚Äôs five-banked galley
was the only one that was making no way. The moment this
was discovered, some of the sailors plunged into the sea, and,
on making search about the ship‚Äôs sides, they found an
echene√Øs adhering to the rudder. Upon its being shown to
the emperor, he strongly expressed his indignation that such
an obstacle as this should have impeded his progress, and have
rendered powerless the hearty endeavours of some four hundred
men. One thing, too, it is well known, more particularly
surprised<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> him, how it was possible that the fish, while adhering
to the ship, should arrest its progress, and yet should
have no such power when brought on board.</p>

<p>According to the persons who examined it on that occasion,
and who have seen it since, the echene√Øs bears a strong resemblance
to a large slug.<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> The various opinions entertained
respecting it we have already<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> noticed, when speaking of it
in the Natural History of Fishes. There is no doubt, too, that
all fish of this kind are possessed of a similar power; witness,
for example, the well-known instance of the shells<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> which
are still preserved and consecrated in the Temple of Venus at
Cnidos, and which, we are bound to believe, once gave such
striking evidence of the possession of similar properties.
Some of our own authors have given this fish the Latin name
of ‚Äúmora.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> It is a singular thing, but among the Greeks
we find writers who state that, worn as an amulet, the echene√Øs
has the property,<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> as already mentioned, of preventing miscarriage,
and of reducing procidence of the uterus, and so permitting
the f≈ìtus to reach maturity: while others, again,
assert that, if it is preserved in salt and worn as an amulet, it
will facilitate parturition; a fact to which it is indebted for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
another name which it bears, ‚Äúodinolytes.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Be all this as
it may, considering this most remarkable fact of a ship being
thus stopped in its course, who can entertain a doubt as to the
possibility of any manifestation of her power by Nature, or
as to the effectual operation of the remedies which she has
centred in her spontaneous productions?</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXII_CHAP_2"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 2.‚ÄîTHE TORPEDO: NINE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>And then, besides, even if we had not this illustration by
the agency of the echene√Øs, would it not have been quite sufficient
only to cite the instance of the torpedo,<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> another inhabitant
also of the sea, as a manifestation of the mighty
powers of Nature? From a considerable distance even, and if
only touched with the end of a spear or staff, this fish has the
property of benumbing even the most vigorous arm, and of
rivetting the feet of the runner, however swift he may be in
the race. If, upon considering this fresh illustration, we find
ourselves compelled to admit that there is in existence a certain
power which, by the very exhalations<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and, as it were, emanations
therefrom, is enabled to affect the members of the human
body,<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> what are we not to hope for from the remedial
influences which Nature has centred in all animated beings?</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXII_CHAP_3"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 3.‚ÄîTHE SEA HARE: FIVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>No less wonderful, too, are the particulars which we find
stated relative to the sea-hare.<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Taken with the food or
drink, it is a poison to some persons; while to others, again,
the very sight of it is venomous.<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Indeed, if a woman in a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
state of pregnancy so much as looks upon one of these fishes,
she is immediately seized with nausea and vomiting‚Äîa proof
that the injury has reached the stomach‚Äîand abortion is the
ultimate result. The proper preservative against these baneful
effects is the male fish, which is kept dried for the purpose
in salt, and worn in a bracelet upon the arm. And yet this
same fish, while in the sea, is not injurious, by its contact
even. The only animal that eats it without fatal consequences,
is the mullet;<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> the sole perceptible result being that its flesh
is rendered more tender thereby, but deteriorated in flavour,
and consequently not so highly esteemed.</p>

<p>Persons when poisoned<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> by the sea-hare smell strongly of
the fish‚Äîthe first sign, indeed, by which the fact of their
having been so poisoned is detected. Death also ensues at the
end of as many days as the fish has lived: hence it is that,
as Licinius Macer informs us, this is one of those poisons
which have no definite time for their operation. In India,<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> we
are assured, the sea-hare is never taken alive; and, we are told
that, in those parts of the world, man, in his turn, acts as a
poison upon the fish, which dies instantly in the sea, if it is
only touched with the human finger. There, like the rest
of the animals, it attains a much larger size than it does
with us.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXII_CHAP_4"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 4.‚ÄîMARVELS OF THE RED SEA.</span></h3></div>

<p>Juba, in those books descriptive of Arabia, which he has
dedicated to Caius C√¶sar, the son of Augustus, informs us that
there are mussels<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> on those coasts, the shells of which are
capable of holding three semisextarii; and that, on one occasion,
a whale,<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> six hundred feet in length and three hundred
and sixty feet broad,<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> made its way up a river of Arabia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
the blubber of which was bought up by the merchants there.
He tells us, too, that in those parts they anoint their camels
with the grease of all kinds of fish, for the purpose of keeping
off the gad-flies<a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> by the smell.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXII_CHAP_5"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 5. (2.)‚ÄîTHE INSTINCTS OF FISHES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The statements which Ovid has made as to the instincts
of fish, in the work<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> of his known as the ‚ÄúHalieuticon,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
appear to me truly marvellous. The scarus,<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> for instance,
when enclosed in the wicker kype, makes no effort to escape
with its head, nor does it attempt to thrust its muzzle between
the oziers; but turning its tail towards them, it enlarges the
orifices with repeated blows therefrom, and so makes its escape
backwards. Should,<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> too, another scarus, from without, chance
to see it thus struggling within the kype, it will take the tail
of the other in its mouth, and so aid it in its efforts to escape.
The lupus,<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> again, when surrounded with the net, furrows<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
the sand with its tail, and so conceals itself, until the net has
passed over it. The mur√¶na,<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> trusting in the slippery smoothness<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
of its rounded back, boldly faces the meshes of the net,
and by repeatedly wriggling its body, makes its escape. The
polyp<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> makes for the hooks, and, without swallowing the bait,
clasps it with its feelers; nor does it quit its hold until it has
eaten off the bait, or perceives itself being drawn out of the
water by the rod.</p>

<p>The mullet,<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> too, is aware<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> that within the bait there is a
hook concealed, and is on its guard against the ambush; still
however, so great is its voracity, that it beats the hook with
its tail, and strikes away from it the bait. The lupus,<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> again,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
shows less foresight and address, but repentance at its imprudence
arms it with mighty strength; for, when caught by the
hook, it flounders from side to side, and so widens the wound,
till at last the insidious hook falls from its mouth. The mur√¶na<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
not only swallows the hook, but catches at the line
with its teeth, and so gnaws it asunder. The anthias,<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>  Ovid
says, the moment it finds itself caught by the hook, turns its
body with its back downwards, upon which there is a sharp
knife-like fin, and so cuts the line asunder.</p>

<p>According to Licinius Macer, the mur√¶na is of the female
sex only, and is impregnated by serpents, as already<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> mentioned;
and hence it is that the fishermen, to entice it from its
retreat, and catch it, make a hissing noise in imitation of the
hissing of a serpent. He states, also, that by frequently beating
the water it is made to grow fat, that a blow with a stout
stick will not kill it, but that a touch with a stalk of fennel-giant<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
is instantly fatal. That in the case of this animal, the
life is centred in the tail, there can be no doubt, as also that
it dies immediately on that part of the body being struck;
while, on the other hand, there is considerable difficulty in
killing it with a blow upon the head. Persons who have
come in contact with the razor-fish<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> smell of iron.<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> The
hardest of all fishes, beyond a doubt, is that known as the
‚Äúorbis:‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> it is spherical, destitute<a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> of scales, and all head.<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>Trebius Niger informs us that whenever the loligo<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> is seen
darting above the surface of the water, it portends a change
of weather: that the xiphias,<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> or, in other words, the swordfish,
has a sharp-pointed muzzle, with which it is able to pierce
the sides of a ship and send it to the bottom: instances of
which have been known near a place in Mauritania, known as
Cotte, not far from the river Lixus.<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> He says, too, that the
loligo sometimes darts above the surface, in such vast numbers,
as to sink the ships upon which they fall.</p>

CHAP. 7.‚ÄîPLACES WHERE FISH EAT FROM THE HAND.</span></h3></div>

<p>At many of the country-seats belonging to the Emperor the
fish eat<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> from the hand: but the stories of this nature, told
with such admiration by the ancients, bear reference to lakes
formed by Nature, and not to fish-preserves; that at Elorus, a
fortified place in Sicily, for instance, not far from Syracuse.
In the fountain, too, of Jupiter, at Labranda,<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> there are eels
which eat from the hand, and wear ear-rings,<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> it is said. The
same, too, at Chios, near the Old Men‚Äôs Temple<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> there; and

ORACULAR RESPONSES GIVEN BY FISH.</span></h3></div>

<p>At Myra, too, in Lycia, the fish in the Fountain of Apollo,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
known as Surium, appear and give oracular presages, when
thrice summoned by the sound of a flute. If they seize the
flesh thrown to them with avidity, it is a good omen for the
person who consults them; but if, on the other hand, they
flap at it with their tails, it is considered an evil presage. At
Hierapolis<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> in Syria, the fish in the Lake of Venus there obey
the voice of the officers of the temple: bedecked with ornaments
of gold, they come at their call, fawn upon them while
they are scratched, and open their mouths so wide as to admit
of the insertion of the hands.</p>

<p>Off the Rock of Hercules, in the territory of Stabi√¶<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> in
Campania, the melanuri<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> seize with avidity bread that is thrown
to them in the sea, but they will never approach any bait in
which there is a hook concealed.</p>

CHAP. 9.‚ÄîPLACES WHERE BITTER FISH ARE FOUND, SALT, OR
SWEET.</span></h3></div>

<p>Nor is it by any means the least surprising fact, that off the
island of Pele,<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> the town of Clazomen√¶,<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> the rock<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> [of
Scylla] in Sicily, and in the vicinity of Leptis in Africa,<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a
>
Eub≈ìa, and Dyrrhachium,<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> the fish are bitter. In the neighbourhood
of Cephallenia, Ampelos, Paros, and the rocks of
Delos, the fish are so salt by nature that they might easily be
taken to have been pickled in brine. In the harbour, again,
of the last-mentioned island, the fish are sweet: differences,
all of them, resulting, no doubt, from the diversity<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> of their
food.</p>

<p>Apion says that the largest among the fishes is the sea-pig,<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
known to the Laced√¶monians as the ‚Äúorthagoriscos;‚Äù<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
he states also that it grunts<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> like a hog when taken. These
accidental varieties in the natural flavour of fish‚Äîa thing that
is still more surprising‚Äîmay, in some cases, be owing to the
nature of the locality; an apposite illustration of which is, the
well-known fact that, at Beneventum<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> in Italy, salted provisions
of all kinds require<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> to be salted over again.</p>

<p>Cassius Hemina informs us that sea-fish have been in use
at Rome from the time of its foundation. I will give his own
words, however, upon the subject:‚Äî‚ÄúNuma ordained that fish
without<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> scales should not be served up at the Festivals of

that the banquets, both public and private, as well as the
repasts laid before the couches<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> of the gods, might be provided
at a smaller expense than formerly: it being also his
wish to preclude the risk that the caterers for the sacred
banquets would spare no expense in buying provisions, and so
forestall the market.‚Äù</p>

CHAP. 11.‚ÄîCORAL: FORTY-THREE REMEDIES AND OBSERVATIONS.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the same degree that people in our part of the world
set a value upon the pearls of India‚Äîa subject on which we
have already spoken<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> on the appropriate occasion at sufficient
length‚Äîdo the people of India prize coral: it being the
prevailing taste in each nation respectively that constitutes
the value of things. Coral is produced in the Red Sea also,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
but of a more swarthy hue than ours. It is to be found also
in the Persian Gulf, where it is known by the name of ‚Äúiace.‚Äù
But the most highly-esteemed of all, is that produced in the
vicinity of the islands called St≈ìchades,<a id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> in the Gallic Gulf,
and near the √Üolian Islands and the town of Drepana in the
Sea of Sicily. Coral is to be found growing, too, at Gravisc√¶,
and off the coast of Neapolis in Campania: as also at Erythr√¶,
where it is intensely red, but soft, and consequently little
valued.</p>

<p>Its form is that of a shrub,<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> and its colour green: its
berries are white and soft while under water, but the moment
they are removed from it, they become hard and red, resembling
the berries of cultivated cornel in size and appearance.
They say that, while alive, if it is only touched by a person,
it will immediately become as hard as stone; and hence it is
that the greatest pains are taken to prevent this, by tearing it
up from the bottom with nets, or else cutting it short with
a sharp-edged instrument of iron: from which last circumstance
it is generally supposed to have received its name of
‚Äúcuralium.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> The reddest coral and the most branchy is
held in the highest esteem; but, at the same time, it must
not be rough or hard like stone; nor yet, on the other hand,
should it be full of holes or hollow.</p>

<p>The berries of coral are no less esteemed by the men in India
than are the pearls of that country by the females among us:
their soothsayers, too, and diviners look upon coral as an amulet
endowed with sacred properties,<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> and a sure preservative
against all dangers: hence it is that they equally value it as
an ornament and as an object of devotion. Before it was
known in what estimation coral was held by the people of
India, the Gauls were in the habit of adorning their swords,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
shields, and helmets with it; but at the present day, owing to
the value set upon it as an article of exportation, it has become
so extremely rare, that it is seldom to be seen even in the
regions that produce it. Branches of coral, hung at the neck
of infants,<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> are thought to act as a preservative against danger.
Calcined, pulverized, and taken in water, coral gives relief to
patients suffering from griping pains in the bowels, affections
of the bladder, and urinary calculi. Similarly taken in
wine, or, if there are symptoms of fever, in water, it acts as a
soporific. It resists the action of fire a considerable time before
it is calcined.</p>

<p>There is also a statement made that if this medicament is
frequently taken internally, the spleen will be gradually consumed.
Powdered coral, too, is on excellent remedy for patients
who bring up or spit blood. Calcined coral is used as
an ingredient in compositions for the eyes, being productive of
certain astringent and cooling effects: it makes flesh, also, in
the cavities left by ulcers, and effaces scars upon the skin.</p>

enmity to the pastinaca in particular, just as on dry land the

CHAP. 13. (3).‚ÄîAMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS. CASTOREUM: SIXTY-SIX
REMEDIES AND OBSERVATIONS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The might of Nature, too, is equally conspicuous in the
animals which live upon dry land as well;<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> the beaver, for
instance, more generally known as ‚Äúcastor,‚Äù and the testes<a id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> of
which are called in medicine ‚Äúcastorea.‚Äù Sextius, a most
careful enquirer into the nature and history of medicinal substances,
assures us that it is not the truth that this animal,
when on the point of being taken, bites off its testes: he informs
us, also, that these substances are small, tightly knit,
and attached to the back-bone, and that it is impossible to
remove them without taking the animal‚Äôs life. We learn from
him that there is a mode of adulterating them by substituting
the kidneys of the beaver, which are of considerable size,
whereas the genuine testes are found to be extremely diminutive:
in addition to which, he says that they must not be taken
to be bladders, as they are two in number, a provision not to be
found in any animal. Within these pouches,<a id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> he says, there
is a liquid found, which is preserved by being put in salt; the
genuine castoreum being easily known from the false, by the
fact of its being contained in two pouches, attached by a single
ligament. The genuine article, he says, is sometimes fraudulently
sophisticated by the admixture of gum and blood, or
else hammoniacum:<a id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> as the pouches, in fact, ought to be of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
the same colour as this last, covered with thin coats full of a
liquid of the consistency of honey mixed with wax, possessed
of a fetid smell, of a bitter, acrid taste, and friable to the
touch.</p>

<p>The most efficacious castoreum is that which comes from
Pontus and Galatia, the next best being the produce of Africa.
When inhaled, it acts as a sternutatory. Mixed with oil of
roses and peucedanum,<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> and applied to the head, it is productive
of narcotic effects‚Äîa result which is equally produced by
taking it in water; for which reason it is employed in the
treatment of phrenitis. Used as a fumigation, it acts as an
excitant upon patients suffering from lethargy: and similarly
employed, or used in the form of a suppository, it dispels hysterical<a id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
suffocations. It acts also as an emmenagogue and as
an expellent of the afterbirth, being taken by the patient, in
doses of two drachm√¶, with pennyroyal,<a id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> in water. It is employed
also for the cure of vertigo, opisthotony, fits of trembling,
spasms, affections of the sinews, sciatica, stomachic
complaints, and paralysis, the patient either being rubbed with
it all over, or else taking it as an electuary, bruised and incorporated
with seed of vitex,<a id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> vinegar, and oil of roses, to the
consistency of honey. In the last form, too, it is taken for the
cure of epilepsy, and in a potion, for the purpose of dispelling
flatulency and gripings in the bowels, and for counteracting the
effects of poison.</p>

<p>When taken as a potion, the only difference is in the mode
of mixing it, according to the poison that it is intended to
neutralize; thus, for example, when it is taken for the sting
of the scorpion, wine is used as the medium; and when for
injuries inflicted by spiders or by the phalangium,<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> honied
wine where it is intended to be brought up again, and rue
where it is desirable that it should remain upon the stomach.
For injuries inflicted by the chalcis,<a id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> it is taken with myrtle
wine; for the sting of the cerastes<a id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> or prester<a id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> with panax<a id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
rue in wine; and for those of other serpents, with wine only.
In all these cases two drachm√¶ of castoreum is the proper
dose, to one of the other ingredients respectively. It is particularly
useful, also, in combination with vinegar, in cases
where viscus<a id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> has been taken internally, and, with milk or
water, as a neutralizer of aconite: as an antidote to white
hellebore it is taken with hydromel and nitre.<a id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> It is curative,
also, of tooth-ache, for which purpose it is beaten up
with oil and injected into the ear, on the side affected. For
the cure of ear-ache, the best plan is to mix it with meconium.<a id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>
Applied with Attic honey in the form of an ointment,
it improves the eyesight, and taken with vinegar it arrests
hiccup.</p>

<p>The urine, too, of the beaver, is a neutralizer of poisons,
and for this reason is used as an ingredient in antidotes. The
best way of keeping it, some think, is in the bladder of the
animal.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXII_CHAP_14"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 14. (4.)‚ÄîTHE TORTOISE: SIXTY-SIX REMEDIES AND OBSERVATIONS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The tortoise,<a id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> too, is an animal that is equally amphibious
with the beaver, and possessed of medicinal properties as
strongly developed; in addition to which, it claims an equal
degree of notice for the high price which luxury sets upon its
shell,<a id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> and the singularity of its conformation. Of tortoises,
there are various kinds, land tortoises,<a id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> sea tortoises,<a id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> tortoises<a id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>
which live in muddy waters, and tortoises<a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> which live in fresh;
these last being known to some Greek authors by the name of
‚Äúemydes.‚Äù The flesh of the land-tortoise is employed for
fumigations more particularly, and we find it asserted that it
is highly salutary for repelling the malpractices of magic, and for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
neutralizing poisons. These tortoises are found in the greatest
numbers in Africa; where the head and feet being first cut off,
it is said, they are given to persons by way of antidote.
Eaten, too, in a broth made from them, they are thought to
disperse scrofula, diminish the volume of the spleen, and effect
the cure of epilepsy. The blood of the land-tortoise improves
the eyesight, and removes cataract: it is kept also, made up
with meal into pills, which are given with wine when necessary,
to neutralize the poison of all kinds of serpents, frogs,
spiders, and similar venomous animals. It is found a useful
plan, too, in cases of glaucoma, to anoint the eyes with gall of
tortoises, mixed with Attic honey, and, for the cure of injuries
inflicted by scorpions, to drop the gall into the wound.</p>

<p>Ashes of tortoiseshell, kneaded up with wine and oil, are
used for the cure of chaps upon the feet, and of ulcerations.
The shavings of the surface of the shell, administered in drink,
act as an antaphrodisiac: a thing that is the more surprising,
from the fact that a powder prepared from the whole of the shell
has the reputation of being a strong aphrodisiac. As to the urine
of the land-tortoise, I do not think that it can be obtained
otherwise than by opening it and taking out the bladder; this
being one of those substances to which the adepts in magic
attribute such marvellous properties. For the sting of the
asp, they say, it is wonderfully effectual; and even more so,
if bugs are mixed with it. The eggs of the tortoise, hardened
by keeping, are applied to scrofulous sores and ulcers arising
from burns or cold: they are taken also for pains in the
stomach.</p>

<p>The flesh of the sea-tortoise,<a id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> mixed with that of frogs, is
an excellent remedy for injuries caused by the salamander;<a id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
indeed there is nothing that is a better neutralizer of the secretions
of the salamander than the sea-tortoise. The blood of
this animal reproduces the hair when lost through alopecy,
and is curative of porrigo and all kinds of ulcerations of the
head; the proper method of using it being to let it dry, and
then gently wash it off. For the cure of ear-ache, this blood
is injected with woman‚Äôs milk, and for epilepsy it is eaten
with fine wheaten flour, three hemin√¶ of the blood being
mixed with one hemina of vinegar. It is prescribed also for
the cure of asthma; but in this case in combination with one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
hemina of wine. Sometimes, too, it is taken by asthmatic
patients, with barley-meal and vinegar, in pieces about the
size of a bean; one of these pieces being taken each morning
and evening at first, but after some days, two in the
evening. In cases of epilepsy, the mouth of the patient
is opened and this blood introduced. For spasmodic affections,
when not of a violent nature, it is injected, in combination with
castoreum, as a clyster. If a person rinses his teeth three
times a year with blood of tortoises, he will be always exempt
from tooth-ache. This blood is also a cure for asthmatic
affections, and for the malady called ‚Äúorthopn≈ìa,‚Äù being administered
for these purposes in polenta.</p>

<p>The gall of the tortoise improves the eye-sight, effaces scars,
and cures affections of the tonsillary glands, quinsy, and all
kinds of diseases of the mouth, cancers of that part more particularly,
as well as cancer of the testes. Applied to the nostrils
it dispels epilepsy, and sets the patient on his feet:
incorporated in vinegar with the slough of a snake, it is a
sovereign remedy for purulent discharges from the ears. Some
persons add ox-gall and the broth of boiled tortoise-flesh, with
an equal proportion of snake‚Äôs slough; but in such case, care
must be taken to boil the tortoise in wine. Applied with
honey, this gall is curative of all diseases of the eyes; and
for the cure of cataract, gall of the sea-tortoise is used, in
combination with blood of the river-tortoise and milk. The
hair, too, of females, is dyed<a id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> with this gall. For the cure of
injuries inflicted by the salamander, it will be quite sufficient
to drink the broth of boiled tortoise-flesh.</p>

<p>There is, again, a third<a id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> kind of tortoise, which inhabits mud
and swampy localities: the shell on its back is flat and broad,
like that upon the breast, and the callipash is not arched and
rounded, the creature being altogether of a repulsive appearance.
However, there are some remedial medicaments to be
derived even from this animal. Thus, for instance, three of
them are thrown into a fire made with wood cuttings, and the
moment their shells begin to separate they are taken off: the
flesh is then removed, and boiled with a little salt, in one congius
of water. When the water has boiled down to one third,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the broth is used, being taken by persons apprehensive of
paralysis or of diseases of the joints. The gall, too, is found
very useful for carrying off pituitous humours and corrupt
blood: taken in cold water, it has an astringent effect upon
the bowels.</p>

<p>There is a fourth kind of tortoise, which frequents rivers.
When used for its remedial properties, the shell of the animal
is removed, and the fat separated from the flesh and beaten up
with the plant aizo√ºm,<a id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> in combination with unguent and lily
seed: a preparation highly effectual, it is said, for the cure of
quartan fevers, the patient being rubbed with it all over, the
head excepted, just before the paroxysms come on, and then
well wrapped up and made to drink hot water. It is stated
also, that to obtain as much fat as possible, the tortoise should
be taken on the fifteenth day of the moon, the patient being
anointed on the sixteenth. The blood of this tortoise, dropt,
by way of embrocation, upon the region of the brain, allays
head-ache; it is curative also of scrofulous sores. Some persons
recommend that the tortoise should be laid<a id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> upon its back
and its head cut off with a copper knife, the blood being received
in a new earthen vessel; and they assure us that the
blood of any kind of tortoise, when thus obtained, will be an
excellent liniment for the cure of erysipelas, running ulcers
upon the head, and warts. Upon the same authority, too, we
are assured that the dung of any kind of tortoise is good for
the removal of inflammatory tumours. Incredible also as
the statement is, we find it asserted by some, that ships<a id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> make
way more slowly when they have the right foot of a tortoise
on board.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to classify the various remedies derived
from the aquatic animals, according to the several diseases;
not that we are by any means unaware that an exposition
of all the properties of each animal at once, would be
more to the reader‚Äôs taste, and more likely to excite his admiration;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
but because we consider it more conducive to the
practical benefit of mankind to have the various recipes thus
grouped and classified; seeing that this thing may be good for
one patient, that for another, and that some of these remedies
may be more easily met with in one place and some in another.</p>

CHAP. 16. (5.)‚ÄîREMEDIES FOR POISONS, AND FOR NOXIOUS SPELLS.
THE DORADE: FOUR REMEDIES. THE SEA-STAR: SEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have already<a id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> stated in what country the honey is
venomous: the fish known as the dorade<a id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> is an antidote to its
effects. Honey, even in a pure state, is sometimes productive of
surfeit, and of fits of indigestion, remarkable for their severity;
the best remedy in such case, according to Pelops, is to cut off
the feet, head, and tail, of a tortoise, and boil and eat the
body; in place, however, of the tortoise, Apelles mentions
the scincus, an animal which has been described elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
We have already mentioned too, on several occasions,<a id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> how
highly venomous is the menstruous fluid: the surmullet, as
already<a id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> stated, entirely neutralizes its effects. This last fish,
too, either applied topically or taken as food, acts as an antidote
to the venom<a id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> of the pastinaca, the land and sea scorpion,
the dragon,<a id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> and the phalangium.<a id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> The head of this
fish, taken fresh and reduced to ashes, is an active neutralizer
of all poisons, that of fungi more particularly.</p>

<p>It is asserted also, that if the fish called the sea-star<a id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> is
smeared with a fox‚Äôs blood, and then nailed to the upper lintel
of the door, or to the door itself, with a copper nail, no noxious
spells will be able to obtain admittance, or, at all events, to be
productive of any ill effects.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

CHAP. 17.‚ÄîREMEDIES FOR THE STINGS OF SERPENTS, FOR THE
BITES OF DOGS, AND FOR INJURIES INFLICTED BY VENOMOUS
ANIMALS. THE SEA-DRAGON: THREE REMEDIES. TWENTY-FIVE
REMEDIES DERIVED FROM SALTED FISH. THE SARDA: ONE
REMEDY. ELEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM CYBIUM.</span></h3></div>


<p>Stings inflicted by the sea-dragon<a id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> or by the sea-scorpion,
are cured by an application<a id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> of the flesh of those animals to
the wound; the bites, too, of spiders are healed by the same
means. In fine, as an antidote to every kind of poison, whether
taken internally or acting through the agency of a sting or
bite, there is considered to be nothing in existence more effectual
than a decoction of the sea-dragon and sea-scorpion.</p>

<p>There are also certain remedies of this nature derived from
preserved fish. Persons, for instance, who have received injuries
from serpents, or have been bitten by other venomous
animals, are recommended to eat salt fish, and to drink undiluted
wine every now and then, so as, through its agency, to
bring up the whole of the food again by vomit: this method
being particularly good in cases where injuries have been
received from the lizard called ‚Äúchalcis,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> the cerastes,<a id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
the reptile known as the ‚Äúseps,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> the elops,<a id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> or the dipsas.<a id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>
For the sting of the scorpion, salted fish should be taken in
larger quantities, but not brought up again, the patient submitting
to any amount of thirst it may create: salt fish, too,
should be applied, by way of plaster, to the wound. For the
bite of the crocodile there is no more efficient remedy known.
For the sting of the serpent called ‚Äúprester,‚Äù the sarda<a id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> is
particularly good. Salt fish is employed also as a topical application
for the bite of the mad dog; and even in cases where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the wound has not been cauterized with hot iron, this is found
to be sufficiently effectual as a remedy. For injuries, also,
inflicted by the sea-dragon,<a id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> an application is made of salt
fish steeped in vinegar. Cybium,<a id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> too, is productive of similar
effects. As a cure for the venomous sting inflicted with its
stickle by the sea-dragon, the fish itself is applied topically
to the wound, or else its brain, extracted whole.</p>

CHAP. 18.‚ÄîTHE SEA-FROG: SIX REMEDIES. THE RIVER-FROG:
FIFTY-TWO REMEDIES. THE BRAMBLE-FROG: ONE REMEDY.
THIRTY-TWO OBSERVATIONS ON THESE ANIMALS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The broth prepared from sea-frogs,<a id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> boiled in wine and vinegar,
is taken internally as a neutralizer of poisons and of the
venom of the bramble-frog,<a id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> as also for injuries inflicted by
the salamander.<a id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> For the cure of injuries caused by the sea-hare
and the various serpents above mentioned, it is a good
plan to eat the flesh of river-frogs, or to drink the liquor in
which they have been boiled: as a neutralizer, too, of the
venom of the scorpion, river-frogs are taken in wine. Democritus
assures us that if the tongue is extracted from a live
frog, with no other part of the body adhering to it, and is
then applied‚Äîthe frog being first replaced in the water‚Äîto a
woman while asleep, just at the spot where the heart is felt to
palpitate, she will be sure to give a truthful answer to any
question that may be put to her.</p>

<p>To this the Magi<a id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> add some other particulars, which, if there
is any truth in them, would lead us to believe that frogs ought
to be considered much more useful to society than laws.<a id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
They say, for instance, that if a man takes a frog and transfixes
it with a reed, entering the body at the sexual parts and
coming out at the mouth, and then dips the reed in the menstrual
discharge of his wife, she will be sure to conceive an
aversion for all paramours. That the flesh of frogs, attached
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>to the kype or hook, as the case may be, makes a most excellent
bait, for purples more particularly, is a well-known fact.
Frogs, they say, have a double<a id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> liver; and of this liver, when
exposed to the attacks of ants, the part that is most eaten
away is thought to be an effectual antidote to every kind of
poison.</p>

<p>There are some frogs, again, which live only among brakes
and thickets, for which reason they have received the name of
‚Äúrubet√¶,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> or ‚Äúbramble-frogs,‚Äù as already<a id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> stated. The
Greeks call them ‚Äúphryni:‚Äù they are the largest in size of
all the frogs, have two protuberances<a id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> like horns, and are
full<a id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> of poison. Authors quite vie with one another in relating
marvellous stories about them; such, for instance, as that
if they are brought into the midst of a concourse of people,
silence will instantly prevail; as also that by throwing into boiling
water a small bone that is found in their right side, the
vessel will immediately cool, and the water refuse to boil again
until it has been removed. This bone, they say, may be
found by exposing a dead bramble-frog to ants, and letting
them eat away the flesh: after which the bones must be put
into the vessel,<a id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> one by one.</p>

<p>On the other hand, again, in the left side of this reptile
there is another bone, they say, which, thrown into water, has
all the appearance of making it boil, and the name given to
which is ‚Äúapocynon.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> This bone, it is said, has the property
of assuaging the fury of dogs, and, if put into the drink,
of conciliating love and ending discord and strife. Worn,
too, as an amulet, it acts as an aphrodisiac, we are told. The
bone, on the contrary, which is taken from the right side, acts
powerfully as a refrigerative upon boiling liquids, it is said:
attached to the patient in a piece of fresh lamb‚Äôs-skin, it has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>the repute of assuaging quartan and other fevers, and of checking
amorous propensities. The spleen of these frogs is used as
an antidote to the various poisons that are prepared from them;
and for all these purposes the liver is considered still more
efficacious.</p>

FOURTEEN REMEDIES. THE SEA-CRAB: SEVEN REMEDIES. THE
RIVER-SNAIL: SEVEN REMEDIES. THE CORACINUS: FOUR REMEDIES.
THE SEA-PIG: TWO REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is also a snake<a id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> which lives in the water, the fat and
gall of which, carried about them by persons when in pursuit
of the crocodile, are said to be marvellously efficacious, the
beast not venturing, in such case, to make an attack upon
them. As such preservative, they are still more effectual
if mixed with the herbaceous plant known as potamogiton.<a id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
River-crabs,<a id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> taken fresh and beaten up and drunk in water,
or the ashes of them, kept for the purpose, are useful in all
cases of poisoning, as a counter-poison: taken with asses‚Äô
milk they are particularly serviceable as a neutralizer of the
venom of the scorpion; goats‚Äô milk or any other kind of milk
being substituted where asses‚Äô milk cannot be procured. Wine,
too, should also be used in all such cases. River-crabs, beaten
up with ocimum,<a id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> and applied to scorpions, are fatal to them.
They are possessed of similar virtues, also, for the bites of all
other kinds of venomous animals, the scytale<a id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> in particular,
adders, the sea-hare, and the bramble-frog. The ashes of them,
preserved, are good for persons who give symptoms of hydrophobia
after being bitten by a mad dog, some adding gentian
as well, and administering the mixture in wine. In cases,
too, where hydrophobia has already appeared, it is recommended
that these ashes should be kneaded up into boluses with
wine, and swallowed. If ten of these crabs are tied together
with a handful of ocimum,<a id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> all the scorpions in the neighbourhood,
the magicians say, will be attracted to the spot.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>They recommend, also, that to wounds inflicted by the scorpion,
these crabs, or the ashes of them, should be applied, with
ocimum. For all these purposes, however, sea-crabs, it should
be remembered, are not so useful. Thrasyllus informs us that
there is nothing so antagonistic to serpents as crabs; that
swine, when stung by a serpent, cure themselves by eating
them; and that, while the sun is in the sign of Cancer,<a id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> serpents
suffer the greatest tortures.</p>

<p>The flesh, too, of river-snails, eaten either raw or boiled, is
an excellent antidote to the venom of the scorpion, some persons
keeping them salted for the purpose. These snails are applied,
also, topically to the wound.</p>

<p>The coracinus<a id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> is a fish peculiar to the river Nilus, it is
true, but the particulars we are here relating are for the benefit
of all parts of the world: the flesh of it is most excellent as
an application for the cure of wounds inflicted by scorpions.
In the number of the poisonous fishes we ought to reckon the
sea-pig,<a id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> a fish which causes great suffering to those who have
been pierced with the pointed fin upon its back: the proper
remedy in such case is the slime taken from the other parts
of the body of the fish.</p>

CHAP. 20.‚ÄîTHE SEA-CALF: TEN REMEDIES. THE MUR√ÜNA: ONE
REMEDY. THE HIPPOCAMPUS: NINE REMEDIES. THE SEA-URCHIN:
ELEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>In cases of hydrophobia resulting from the bite of the mad
dog, the practice is to rub the patient‚Äôs face with the fat of
the sea-calf; an application rendered still more efficacious by
the admixture of hy√¶na‚Äôs marrow, oil of mastich, and wax.
Bites inflicted by the mur√¶na are cured by an application of
the head of that fish, reduced to ashes. The pastinaca,<a id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> also,
is remedial for its own bite, the ashes of the same fish, or of
another of the same genus, being applied to the wound with
vinegar. When this fish is intended for food, every portion of
the back that is of a saffron colour should be removed, as well
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>as the whole of the head: care, too, should be taken not to
wash it over much; an observation equally applicable to all
kinds of shell-fish, when intended for food, the flavour being
deteriorated<a id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> thereby.</p>

<p>The hippocampus,<a id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> taken in drink, neutralizes the poison
of the sea-hare. As a counter-poison to dorycnium,<a id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> sea-urchins
are remarkably useful; as also in cases where persons
have taken juice of carpathum<a id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> internally; more particularly
if the urchins are used with the liquor in which they are
boiled. Boiled sea-crabs, too, are looked upon as highly efficacious
in cases of poisoning by dorycnium; and as a neutralizer
of the venom of the sea-hare they are particularly good.</p>

CHAP. 21. (6.)‚ÄîTHE VARIOUS KINDS OF OYSTERS: FIFTY-EIGHT
REMEDIES AND OBSERVATIONS. PURPLES: NINE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Oysters, too, neutralize the venom of the sea-hare‚Äîand now
that we are speaking of oysters, it may possibly be thought that
I have not treated of this subject at sufficient length in the
former part<a id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> of my work, seeing that for this long time past
the palm has been awarded to them at our tables as a most
exquisite dish. Oysters love fresh water and spots<a id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> where
numerous rivers discharge themselves into the sea; hence it
is that the pelagia<a id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> are of such small size and so few in number.
Still, however, we do find them breeding among rocks
and in places far remote from the contact of fresh water, as in
the neighbourhood of Grynium<a id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> and of Myrina,<a id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> for example.
Generally speaking, they increase in size with the increase of
the moon, as already stated by us when<a id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> treating of the aquatic
animals: but it is at the beginning of summer, more particularly,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>and when the rays of the sun penetrate the shallow
waters, that they are swollen with an abundance of milk.<a id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> This,
too, would appear to be the reason why they are so small when
found out at sea; the opacity of the water tending to arrest
their growth, and the moping consequent thereon producing a
comparative indisposition for food.</p>

<p>Oysters are of various colours; in Spain they are red, in
Illyricum of a tawny hue, and at Circeii<a id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> black, both in meat
and shell. But in every country, those oysters are the most
highly esteemed that are compact without being slimy from
their secretions, and are remarkable more for their thickness
than their breadth. They should never be taken in either
muddy or sandy spots, but from a firm, hard bottom; the
meat<a id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> should be compressed, and not of a fleshy consistence;
and the oyster should be free from fringed edges, and lying
wholly in the cavity of the shell. Persons of experience in
these matters add another characteristic; a fine purple thread,
they say, should run round the margins of the beard, this being
looked upon as a sign of superior quality, and obtaining for
them their name of ‚Äúcalliblephara.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>Oysters are all the better for travelling and being removed
to new waters; thus, for example, the oysters of Brundisium,
it is thought, when fed in the waters of Avernus, both retain
their own native juices and acquire the flavour of those of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>Lake Lucrinus.<a id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>  Thus much with reference to the meat of
the oyster; we will now turn to the various countries which
produce it, so that no coast may be deprived of the honours
which properly belong to it. But in giving this description
we will speak in the language of another, using the words of
a writer who has evinced more careful discernment in treating
of this subject than any of the other authors of our day.
These then are the words of Mucianus, in reference to the
oyster:‚Äî‚ÄúThe oysters of Cyzicus<a id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> are larger than those of
Lake Lucrinus,<a id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> fresher<a id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> than those of the British coasts,<a id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
sweeter<a id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> than those of Medul√¶,<a id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> more tasty<a id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> than those of
Ephesus, more plump than those of Lucus,<a id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> less slimy than
those of Coryphas,<a id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> more delicate than those of Istria,<a id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> and
whiter than those of Circeii.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> For all this, however, it is a
fact well ascertained that there are no oysters fresher or more
delicate than those of Circeii, last mentioned.</p>

<p>According to the historians of the expedition of Alexander,
there were oysters found in the Indian Sea a foot<a id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> in diameter:
among ourselves, too, the nomenclature of some spendthrift
and gourmand has found for certain oysters the name of ‚Äútridacna,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>
wishing it to be understood thereby, that they are so
large as to require three bites in eating them. We will
take the present opportunity of stating all the medicinal properties
that are attributed to oysters. They are singularly
refreshing<a id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> to the stomach, and tend to restore the appetite.
Luxury, too, has imparted to them an additional coolness
by burying them in snow, thus making a medley of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>produce of the tops of mountains and the bottom of the sea.
Oysters are slightly laxative to the bowels; and boiled in
honied wine, they relieve tenesmus, in cases where it is unattended
with ulceration. They act detergently also upon
ulcerations of the bladder.<a id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> Boiled in their shells, unopened
just as they come to hand, oysters are marvellously efficacious
for rheumatic defluxions. Calcined oyster-shells, mixed with
honey, allay affections of the uvula and of the tonsillary glands:
they are similarly used for imposthumes of the parotid glands,
inflamed tumours, and indurations of the mamill√¶. Applied
with water, these ashes are good for ulcerations of the head,
and impart a plumpness to the skin in females. They are
sprinkled, too, upon burns, and are highly esteemed as a dentifrice.
Applied with vinegar, they are good for the removal
of prurigo and of pituitous eruptions. Beaten up in a raw
state, they are curative of scrofula and of chilblains upon the
feet.</p>

<p>Purples, too, are useful<a id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> as a counterpoison.</p>

are numerous varieties of it, as already<a id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> stated; one, for instance,
with an elongated leaf, another red, another again with a
broader leaf, and another crisped. The most esteemed kind of
all is that which grows off the shores of Crete, upon the rocks
there, close to the ground: it being used also for dyeing wool,
as it has the property<a id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> of so fixing the colours as never to
allow of their being washed out. Nicander recommends it to
be taken with wine.</p>

Alopecy is cured also with ashes of the sea-mouse,<a id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> mixed with
oil; ashes of the sea-urchin, burnt, flesh and all together;

burnt alive in an earthen pot, applied with honey, or what
is still better, in combination with tar. Leeches left to putrefy
for forty days in red wine stain the hair black. Others, again,
recommend one sextarius of leeches to be left to putrefy the
same number of days in a leaden vessel, with two sextarii of
vinegar, the hair to be well rubbed with the mixture in the
sun. According to Sornatius, this preparation is naturally
so penetrating, that if females, when they apply it, do not
take the precaution of keeping some oil in the mouth, the
teeth even will become blackened thereby. Ashes of burnt
shells of the murex or purple are used as a liniment, with honey,
for ulcerations of the head; the shells, too, of other shell-fish,<a id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>

<p>The fat of all kinds of fish, both fresh-water as well as sea
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>fish, melted in the sun and incorporated with honey, is an
excellent improver of the eye-sight;<a id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> the same, too, with
castoreum,<a id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> in combination with honey. The gall of the
callionymus<a id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> heals marks upon the eyes and cauterizes fleshy
excrescences about those organs: indeed, there is no fish with
a larger quantity of gall than this, an opinion expressed too
by Menander in his Comedies.<a id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> This fish is known also as
the ‚Äúuranoscopos,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> from the eyes being situate in the upper
part of the head.<a id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> The gall, too, of the coracinus<a id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> has the
effect of sharpening the eyesight.</p>

<p>The gall of the red sea-scorpion,<a id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> used with stale oil or Attic
honey, disperses incipient cataract; for which purpose, the
application should be made three times, on alternate days. A
similar method is also employed for removing indurations<a id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> of
the membrane of the eyes. The surmullet, used as a diet,
weakens the eyesight, it is said. The sea-hare is poisonous
itself, but the ashes of it are useful as an application for preventing
superfluous hairs on the eyelids from growing again,
when they have been once pulled out by the roots. For this
purpose, however, the smaller the fish is, the better. Small
scallops, too, are salted and beaten up with cedar resin for a
similar purpose, or else the frogs known as ‚Äúdiopetes‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>‚Äúcalamit√¶,‚Äù are used; the blood of them being applied with vine
gum to the eyelids, after the hairs have been removed.</p>

<p>Powdered shell<a id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> of s√¶pia, applied with woman‚Äôs milk,
allays swellings and inflammations of the eyes; employed by
itself it removes eruptions of the eyelids. When this remedy
is used, it is the practice to turn up the eyelids, and to leave
the medicament there a few moments only; after which, the
part is anointed with oil of roses, and the inflammation modified
by the application of a bread-poultice. Powdered bone
of s√¶pia is used also for the treatment of nyctalopy, being
applied to the eyes with vinegar. Reduced to ashes, this
substance removes scales upon the eyes: applied with honey,
it effaces marks upon those organs: and used with salt and
cadmia,<a id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> one drachma of each, it disperses webs which impede
the eyesight, as also albugo in the eyes of cattle. They
say, too, that if the eyelids are rubbed with the small bone<a id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>
taken from this fish, a perfect cure will be experienced.</p>

<p>Sea-urchins, applied with vinegar, cause epinyctis to disappear.
According to what the magicians say, they should be
burnt with vipers‚Äô skins and frogs, and the ashes sprinkled in
the drink; a great improvement of the eyesight being guaranteed
as the sure result.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIchthyocolla‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> is the name given to a fish with a glutinous
skin; the glue made from which is also known by the same
name, and is highly useful for the removal of epinyctis.
Some persons, however, assert that it is from the belly of the
fish, and not the skin‚Äîas in the case of bull glue‚Äîthat the
ichthyocolla is prepared. That of Pontus<a id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> is highly esteemed:
it is white, free from veins or scales, and dissolves with the
greatest rapidity. The proper way of using it, is to cut it
into small pieces, and then to leave it to soak in water or
vinegar a night and a day, after which it should be pounded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>with sea-shore pebbles, to make it melt the more easily. It
is generally asserted that this substance is good for pains in
the head and for tetanus.</p>

<p>The right eye of a frog, suspended from the neck in a piece
of cloth made from wool of the natural colour,<a id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> is a cure for
ophthalmia in the right eye; and the left eye of a frog, similarly
suspended, for ophthalmia in the left. If the eyes, too,
of a frog are taken out at the time of the moon‚Äôs conjunction,
and similarly worn by the patient, enclosed in an eggshell,
they will effectually remove indurations of the membrane of
the eyes. The rest of the flesh applied topically, removes
all marks resulting from blows. The eyes, too, of a crab,
worn attached to the neck, by way of amulet, are a cure for
ophthalmia, it is said. There is a small frog<a id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> which lives in
reed-beds and among grass more particularly, never croaks,
being quite destitute of voice, is of a green colour, and is apt
to cause tympanitis in cattle, if they should happen to swallow
it. The slimy moisture on this reptile‚Äôs body, scraped off with
a spatula and applied to the eyes, greatly improves the sight,
they say: the flesh, too, is employed as a topical application
for the removal of pains in the eyes.</p>

<p>Some persons take fifteen frogs, and after spitting them
upon as many bulrushes, put them into a new earthen vessel:
they then mix the juices which flow from them, with gum of
the white vine,<a id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> and use it as an application for the eye-lids;
first pulling out such eye-lashes as are in the way, and then
dropping the preparation with the point of a needle into the
places from which the hairs have been removed. Meges<a id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a>
used to prepare a depilatory for the eyelids, by killing frogs
in vinegar, and leaving them to putrefy; for which purpose
he employed the spotted frogs which make their appearance in
vast numbers<a id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> during the rains of autumn. Ashes of burnt
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>leeches, it is thought, applied in vinegar, are productive of a
similar effect; care must be taken, however, to burn them in
a new earthen vessel. Dried liver, too, of the tunny,<a id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> made
up into an ointment, in the proportion of four denarii, with
oil of cedar, and applied as a depilatory for nine months together,
is considered to be highly effectual for this purpose.</p>

<p>For diseases of the ears, fresh gall of the fish called
‚Äúbatia‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> is remarkably good; the same, too, when it has

known as the ‚Äúmyxon,‚Äù is equally good; as also that of the
callionymus,<a id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> injected into the ears with oil of roses, or else
castoreum,<a id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> used with poppy-juice. There are certain animals
too, known as ‚Äúsea-lice,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> which are recommended as an
injection for the ears, beaten up with vinegar. Wool, too,
that has been dyed with the juice of the murex, employed
by itself, is highly useful for this purpose; some persons,
however moisten it with vinegar and nitre.<a id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<p>Others, again, more particularly recommend for all affections
of the ears one cyathus of the best garum,<a id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> with one cyathus
and a half of honey, and one cyathus of vinegar, the whole
gently boiled in a new pot over a slow fire, and skimmed with
a feather every now and then: when it has become wholly
free from scum, it is injected lukewarm into the ears. In
cases where the ears are swollen, the same authorities recommend
that the swellings should be first reduced with juice of
coriander. The fat of frogs, injected into the ears, instantly
removes all pains in these organs. The juice of river-crabs,
kneaded up with barley-meal, is a most effectual remedy for
wounds in the ears. Shells of the murex, reduced to ashes,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>and applied with honey, or the burnt shells of other shell-fish,<a id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>
used with honied wine, are curative of imposthumes of
the parotid glands.</p>

CHAP. 26.‚ÄîREMEDIES FOR TOOTH-ACHE. THE DOG-FISH: FOUR
REMEDIES. WHALE‚ÄôS FLESH.</span></h3></div>

<p>Tooth-ache is alleviated by scarifying the gums with bones
of the sea-dragon, or by rubbing the teeth once a year with
the brains of a dog-fish<a id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> boiled in oil, and kept for the purpose.
It is a very good plan too, for the cure of tooth-ache, to lance
the gums with the sting of the pastinaca<a id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> in some cases.
This sting, too, is pounded, and applied to the teeth with white
hellebore, having the effect of extracting them without the
slightest difficulty. Another of these remedies is, ashes of
salted fish calcined in an earthen vessel, mixed with powdered
marble. Stale cybium,<a id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> rinsed in a new earthen vessel, and
then pounded, is very useful for the cure of tooth-ache.
Equally good, it is said, are the back-bones of all kinds of salt
fish, pounded and applied in a liniment. A decoction is made of
a single frog boiled in one hemina of vinegar, and the teeth
are rinsed with it, the decoction being retained in the mouth.
In cases where a repugnance existed to making use of this
remedy, Sallustius Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> used to suspend frogs over
boiling vinegar by the hind legs, so as to make them discharge
their humours into the vinegar by the mouth, using considerable
numbers of frogs for the purpose: to those, however, who
had a stronger stomach, he prescribed the frogs themselves,
eaten with their broth. It is generally thought, too, that
this recipe applies more particularly to the double teeth, and
that the vinegar prepared as above-mentioned, is remarkably
useful for strengthening them when loose.</p>

<p>For this last purpose, some persons cut off the legs of two
frogs, and then macerate the bodies in two hemin√¶ of wine,
recommending this preparation as a collutory for strengthening
loose teeth. Others attach the frogs, whole, to the exterior of
the jaws:<a id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> and with some it is the practice to boil ten frogs,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>in three sextarii of vinegar, down to one-third, and to use the
decoction as a strengthener of loose teeth. By certain authorities,
too, it has been recommended to boil the hearts of six-and-thirty
frogs beneath a copper vessel, in one sextarius of old
oil, and then to inject the decoction into the ear on the same
side of the jaw as the part affected: while others again have
used, as an application for the teeth, a frog‚Äôs liver, boiled, and
beaten up with honey. All the preparations above described
will be found still more efficacious if made from the sea-frog.<a id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>
In cases where the teeth are carious and emit an
offensive smell, it is recommended to dry some whale‚Äôs<a id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> flesh
in an oven for a night, and then to add an equal quantity of
salt, and use the mixture as a dentifrice. ‚ÄúEnhydris‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> is the
name given by the Greeks to a snake that lives in the water.
With the four upper teeth of this reptile, it is the practice, for
the cure of aching in the upper teeth, to lance the upper gums,
and with the four lower teeth, for aching in the lower. Some
persons, however, content themselves with using an eyetooth
only. Ashes, too, of burnt crabs are used for this purpose;
and the murex, reduced to ashes, makes an excellent dentifrice.</p>

<p>Lichens and leprous spots are removed by applying the fat

of the dolphin or hippocampus<a id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> mixed with water. After the
parts have been duly excoriated, a cicatrizing treatment ought
to be pursued. Some persons bake dolphin‚Äôs liver in an
earthen vessel, till a grease flows therefrom like oil<a id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> in appearance:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>this they use by way of ointment for these diseases.</p>

<p>Burnt shells of the murex or purple, applied with honey,
have a detergent effect upon spots on the face in females:
used as an application for seven consecutive days, a fomentation
made of white of eggs being substituted on the eighth,
they efface wrinkles, and plump out the skin. To the genus
‚Äúmurex‚Äù belong the shell-fish known by the Greeks as ‚Äúcoluthia‚Äù
or ‚Äúcoryphia,‚Äù equally turbinated, but considerably
smaller: for all the above purposes they are still more efficacious,
and the use of them tends to preserve the sweetness of
the breath. Fish-glue<a id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> effaces wrinkles and plumps out the skin;
being boiled for the purpose in water some four hours, and then
pounded and kneaded up till it attains a thin consistency, like
that of honey. After being thus prepared, it is put by in a new
vessel for keeping; and, when wanted for use, is mixed, in
the proportion of four drachm√¶, with two drachm√¶ of sulphur,
two of alkanet, and eight of litharge; the whole being
sprinkled with water and beaten up together. The preparation
is then applied to the face, and is washed off at the end
of four hours. For the cure of freckles and other affections
of the face, calcined bones of cuttle-fish are also used; an
application which is equally good for the removal of fleshy
excrescences and the dispersion of running sores.</p>

<p>(8.) For the cure of itch-scab, a frog is boiled in five semisextarii
of sea-water, the decoction being reduced to the consistency
of honey. There is a sea production called ‚Äúhalcyoneum,‚Äù composed,
as some think, of the nests<a id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> of the birds known as the
‚Äúhalcyon‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> and ‚Äúceyx,‚Äù or, according to others, of the concretion
of sea-foam, or of some slime of the sea, or a certain
lanuginous inflorescence thrown up by it. Of this halcyoneum
there are four different kinds; the first, of an ashy colour, of a
compact substance, and possessed of a pungent odour; the
second, soft, of a milder nature, and with a smell almost identical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>with that of sea-weed; the third, whiter, and with a
variegated surface; the fourth, more like pumice in appearance,
and closely resembling rotten sponge. The best of all is
that which nearly borders upon a purple hue, and is known as
the ‚ÄúMilesian‚Äù kind: the whiter it is, the less highly it is
esteemed.</p>

<p>The properties of halcyoneum are ulcerative and detergent:
when required for use, it is parched and applied without oil.
It is quite marvellous how efficiently it removes leprous sores,
lichens, and freckles, used in combination with lupines and
two oboli of sulphur. It is employed, also, for the removal
of marks upon the eyes.<a id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> Andreas<a id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> has recommended for the

<p>Ulcerations of the mouth are cured by an application of
brine in which m√¶n√¶<a id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> have been pickled, in combination with
calcined heads of the fish, and honey. For the cure of scrofula,
it is a good plan to prick the sores with the small bone
that is found in the tail of the fish known as the sea-frog;<a id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>
care being taken to avoid making a wound, and to repeat the
operation daily, until a perfect cure is effected. The same
property, too, belongs to the sting of the pastinaca, and to the
sea-hare, applied topically to the sores: but in both cases due
care must be taken to remove them in an instant. Shells of
sea-urchins are bruised, also, and applied with vinegar; shells
also of sea-scolopendr√¶,<a id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> applied with honey; and river-crabs
pounded or calcined, and applied with honey. Bones, too, of
the s√¶pia, triturated and applied with stale axle-grease, are
marvellously useful for this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>This last preparation is used, also, for the cure of imposthumes
of the parotid glands; a purpose for which the liver
of the sea-fish known as the ‚Äúsaurus‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> is employed. Nay,
even more than this, fragments of earthen vessels in which
salt fish have been kept are pounded with stale axle-grease,
and applied to scrofulous sores and imposthumes of the parotid
glands; as also calcined murex, incorporated with oil. Stiffness
in the neck is allayed by taking what are known as sea-lice,<a id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a>
in doses of one drachma in drink, taking castoreum<a id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> mixed
with pepper in honied wine, or making a decoction of frogs in
oil and salt, and taking the liquor.</p>

<p>Opisthotony, too, and tetanus are treated in a similar manner;
and spasms, with the addition of pepper. Ashes of burnt
heads of salted m√¶n√¶ are applied externally, with honey, for the
cure of quinsy; as also a decoction of frogs, boiled in vinegar,
a preparation which is equally good for affections of the tonsillary
glands. River-crabs, pounded, one to each hemina of
water, are used as a gargle for the cure of quinsy; or else
they are taken with wine and hot water. Garum,<a id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> put beneath

hammoniacum<a id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> in oxymel, is extremely good for asthma:
spasms, too, in the stomach are assuaged by taking a similar

are good for a cough, it is said. In some cases, also, frogs are
suspended by the legs, and after their juices<a id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> have been received

croaks aloud there: if a person suffering from cough spits into
its mouth and then lets it go, he will experience a cure, it is said.

to beat up the raw flesh of a snail, and to drink it in hot water.</p>

<p>The silurus,<a id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> taken in its broth, or the torpedo,<a id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> used as
food, acts as a laxative upon the bowels. There is a sea-wort,<a id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>
also, similar in appearance to the cultivated cabbage: it is
injurious to the stomach, but acts most efficiently as a purgative,
requiring to be cooked with fat meat for the purpose, in
consequence of its extreme acridity. The broth, too, of all
boiled fish is good for this purpose; it acting, also, as a strong
diuretic, taken with wine more particularly. The best kind
of all is that prepared from the sea-scorpion, the iulis,<a id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>rock-fish in general, as they are destitute of all rankness and
are free from fat. The proper way of cooking them is with
dill, parsley, coriander, and leeks, with the addition of oil and
salt. Stale cybium,<a id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> too, acts as a purgative, and is particularly
useful for carrying off crudities, pituitous humours, and bile.</p>

<p>The myax<a id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> is of a purgative nature, a shell-fish of which
we shall take this opportunity of giving the natural history
at length. These fish collect together in masses, like the
murex,<a id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> and are found in spots covered with sea-weed. They
are the finest eating in autumn, and are found in the greatest
perfection in places where fresh-water streams discharge themselves
into the sea; for which reason it is that those of Egypt
are held in such high esteem. As the winter advances, they
contract a bitter flavour, and assume a reddish hue. The
liquor of these fish, it is said, acts as a purgative upon the
bowels and bladder, has a detergent effect upon the intestines,
acts aperiently upon all the passages, purges the kidneys, and
diminishes the blood and adipose secretions. Hence it is that
these shell-fish are found of the greatest use for the treatment
of dropsy, for the regulation of the catamenia, and for the removal
of jaundice, all diseases of the joints, and flatulency.
They are very good, also, for the reduction of obesity, for
diseases of the bile and of the pituitous secretions, for affections
of the lungs, liver, and spleen, and for rheumatic defluxions.
The only inconvenience resulting from them is, that
they irritate the throat and impede the articulation. They
have, also, a healing effect upon ulcers of a serpiginous nature,
or which stand in need of detergents, as also upon carcinomatous
sores. Calcined, the same way as the murex, and employed
with honey, they are curative of bites inflicted either
by dogs or human beings, and of leprous spots or freckles. The
ashes of them, rinsed, are good for the removal of films upon
the eyes, granulations of those organs and indurations of the
membrane, as also for diseases of the gums and teeth, and for
pituitous eruptions. They serve, also, as an antidote to dorycnium<a id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>
and to opocarpathon.<a id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>There are two species of this shell-fish, of a degenerate kind:
the mitulus,<a id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> which has a strong flavour, and a saltish taste;
and the myisca,<a id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> which differs from the former in the roundness
of its shell, is somewhat smaller, and is covered with filaments,
the shell being thinner, and the meat of a sweeter flavour. The
ashes, also, of the mitulus, like those of the murex, are possessed
of certain caustic properties, and are very useful for the
removal of leprous spots, freckles, and blemishes of the skin.
They are rinsed, too, in the same manner as lead,<a id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> for the
removal of swellings of the eyelids, of indurations of the
membranes, and of films upon the eyes, as also of sordid ulcers
upon other parts of the body, and of pustules upon the head.
The meat of them, also, is employed as an application for bites
inflicted by dogs.</p>

<p>As to pelorides,<a id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> they act as a gentle laxative upon the
bowels, an effect equally produced by castoreum, taken in doses
of two drachm√¶, in hydromel: where, however, a more drastic
purgative is required, one drachma of dried garden-cucumber
root is added, and two drachm√¶ of aphronitrum.<a id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> The
tethea<a id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> is good for griping pains in the bowels and for attacks
of flatulency: they are generally found adhering to the leaves
of marine plants, sucking their nutriment therefrom, and may
be rather looked upon as a sort of fungus than as a fish. They
are useful, also, for the removal of tenesmus and of diseases of
the kidneys.</p>

<p>There grows also in the sea a kind of absinthium, known by
some persons as ‚Äúseriphum,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> and found in the vicinity of
Taposiris,<a id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> in Egypt, more particularly. It is of a more
slender form than the land absinthium, acts as a purgative
upon the bowels, and effectually removes intestinal worms.
The s√¶pia, too, is a laxative; for which purpose these fish are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>administered<a id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> with the food, boiled with a mixture of oil, salt,
and meal. Salted m√¶n√¶,<a id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> applied with bull‚Äôs gall to the navel,
acts as a purgative upon the bowels.</p>

<p>The liquor of fish, boiled in the saucepan with lettuces, dispels
tenesmus. River-crabs,<a id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> beaten up and taken with water, act
astringently upon the bowels, and they have a diuretic effect, if
taken with white wine. Deprived of the legs, and taken in
doses of three oboli with myrrh and iris, one drachma of each,
they disperse urinary calculi. For the cure of the iliac passion
and of attacks of flatulency, castoreum<a id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> should be taken,
with seed of daucus<a id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> and of parsley, a pinch in three fingers
of each, the whole being mixed with four cyathi of warm
honied wine. Griping pains in the bowels should be treated
with castoreum and a mixture of dill and wine. The fish
called ‚Äúerythinus,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> used as food, acts astringently upon the
bowels. Dysentery is cured by taking frogs boiled with squills,
and prepared in the form of boluses, or else hearts of frogs
beaten up with honey, as Niceratus<a id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> recommends. For the
cure of jaundice, salt fish should be taken with pepper, the
patient abstaining from all other kinds of meat.</p>

called ‚Äúbacchus,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> there are found certain small stones, as it

taken in wine, is very useful for this purpose, as also the
pulmo marinus,<a id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> boiled in water. The eggs of the s√¶pia have
a diuretic effect, and carry off pituitous humours from the
kidneys. Ruptures and convulsions are very effectually treated
by taking river-crabs,<a id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> bruised in asses‚Äô milk more particularly;
and urinary calculi by drinking sea-urchins pounded,

the sea-urchin, taken as food, is very useful as a remedy for
the same malady.</p>

<p>Scallops<a id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> also, taken as food, act detergently upon the bladder:

For chafing of the fundament, an application is made of heads
of mullets and surmullets, reduced to ashes; for which purpose
they are calcined in an earthen vessel, and must be applied

too, is used for the same purpose, boiled in wine, and applied
as a fomentation to the part affected. Shells of sea-urchins,
bruised and applied with water, act as a check upon incipient
inflammatory tumours. Ashes of the murex, or of the purple,
are employed in either case, whether it is wanted to disperse
inflammatory tumours in an incipient state, or to bring them
to a head and break them. Some authorities prescribe the following
preparation: of wax and frankincense twenty drachm√¶,
of litharge forty drachm√¶, of calcined murex ten drachm√¶,
and of old oil, one semisextarius. Salt fish, boiled and applied

three cyathi of oxymel, to the patient fasting; but where the
attacks are frequent, it is employed in the form of a clyster,
with marvellous effect. The proper proportions, in this last case,
are two drachm√¶ of castoreum, one sextarius of oil and honey,
and the same quantity of water. At the moment that the
patient is seized with a fit, it is a good plan to give him castoreum,
with vinegar, to smell. The liver, too, of the sea-weasel<a id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a>
is given to epileptic patients, or else that of sea-mice,<a id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a>

<p>Recurrent fevers are effectually checked by making the patient
taste the liver of a dolphin, just before the paroxysm
comes on. Hippocampi<a id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> are stifled in oil of roses, and the patients
are rubbed therewith in cold agues, the fish, also, being
worn as an amulet by the patient. In the same way, too, the
small stones that are found at full moon in the head of the fish
called ‚Äúasellus‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> are worn, attached in a piece of linen cloth
to the patient‚Äôs body. A similar virtue is attributed to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>longest tooth of the river-fish called phagrus,<a id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> attached to
the patient with a hair, provided he does not see the person
who attaches it to him for five days. Frogs are boiled in oil
in a spot where three roads meet, and, the flesh being first
thrown away, the patients are rubbed with the decoction, by
way of cure for quartan fever. Some persons, again, suffocate
frogs in oil, and, after attaching them to the patient without
his knowing it, anoint him with the oil. The heart of a frog,
worn as an amulet, modifies the cold chills in fevers; the
same, too, with oil in which the intestines of frogs have been
boiled. But the best remedy for quartan fevers, is to wear
attached to the body either frogs from which the claws have
been<a id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> removed, or else the liver or heart of a bramble-frog,<a id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>
attached in a piece of russet-coloured cloth.</p>

<p>River-crabs,<a id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> bruised in oil and water, are highly beneficial
in fevers, the patient being anointed with the preparation just
before the paroxysms come on: some authorities recommend
the addition of pepper to the mixture. Others prescribe for
quartan fevers a decoction of river-crabs in wine, boiled down
to one fourth, the patient taking it at the moment of leaving
the bath: by some, too, it is recommended to swallow the left
eye of a river-crab. The magicians engage to cure a tertian
fever, by attaching as an amulet to the patient, before sunrise,
the eyes of river-crabs, the crabs when thus blinded being set
at liberty in the water. They say, too, that these eyes, attached
to the body in a piece of deer‚Äôs hide, with the flesh of a
nightingale,<a id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> will dispel sleep and promote watchfulness. In
cases where there are symptoms of lethargy, the rennet of the
bal√¶na<a id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> or of the sea-calf<a id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> is given to the patient to smell;
some persons, too, use the blood of tortoises as a liniment for
lethargic patients.</p>

<p>Tertian fevers, it is said, may be cured by wearing one of
the vertebr√¶<a id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> of a perch attached to the body, and quartan
fevers by using fresh river snails, as an aliment. Some persons

them, pounded, in drink.</p>

<p>Strombi,<a id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> left to putrefy in vinegar, act as an excitant upon
lethargic patients by their smell; they are very useful, too,

the body is wasting with consumption, tethe√¶<a id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> are considered
beneficial, mixed with rue and honey. For the cure of
dropsy, dolphin‚Äôs fat is melted and taken with wine, the repulsive
taste of it being neutralized by first touching the
nostrils with unguent or some other odoriferous substance, or
else by plugging the nostrils in some way or other. The flesh
of strombi, pounded and given in three hemin√¶ of honied
wine and the same quantity of water, or, if there is fever,
in hydromel, is very useful for dropsy: the same, too, with
the juice of river-crabs, administered with honey. Water
frogs, too, are boiled with old wine and spelt,<a id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> and taken as
food, the liquor in which they have been boiled being drunk
from the same vessel: or else the feet, head, and tail of a
tortoise are cut off, and the intestines removed, the rest of
the flesh being seasoned in such a manner as to allow of
its being taken without loathing. River-crabs, too, eaten with
their broth, are said to be very good for the cure of phthisis.</p>

<p>Burns are cured by applying ashes of calcined sea-crabs or

used as an application for scalds produced by boiling water.
The same treatment also restores the hair, provided the ashes
are those of river-crabs: it is generally thought, too, that the
preparation should be applied with wax and bears‚Äô grease.
Ashes, too, of burnt beaver-skin are very useful for these
purposes. Live frogs act as a check upon erysipelas, the belly
side being applied to the part affected: it is recommended,
too, to attach them lengthwise by the hinder legs, so as to
render them more beneficial by reason of their increased respiration.<a id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a>

CHAP. 42.‚ÄîMETHODS OF ARRESTING H√ÜMORRHAGE AND OF LETTING
BLOOD. THE POLYP: ONE REMEDY.</span></h3></div>

<p>Fish, used as an aliment, it is generally thought, make
blood. The polyp,<a id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> bruised and applied, arrests h√¶morrhage,
it is thought: in addition to which we find stated the following
particulars respecting it‚Äîthat of itself it emits a sort of
brine, in consequence of which, there is no necessity to use
any in cooking it‚Äîthat it should always be sliced with a reed‚Äîand
that it is spoilt by using an iron knife, becoming tainted
thereby, owing to the antipathy<a id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> which naturally exists
[between it and iron]. For the purpose also of arresting
h√¶morrhage, ashes of burnt frogs are applied topically, or else
the dried blood of those animals. Some authorities recommend
the frog to be used, that is known by the Greeks as
‚Äúcalamites,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> from the fact that it lives among reeds<a id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> and
shrubs; it is the smallest and greenest of all the frogs, and
either the blood or the ashes of it are recommended to be employed.
Others, again, prescribe, in cases of bleeding at the
nostrils, an injection of the ashes of young water-frogs, in the
tadpole state, calcined in a new earthen vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, again, in cases where it is required to
let blood, the kind of leech is used which is known among
us by the name of ‚Äúsanguisuga.<a id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a>‚Äù Indeed, the action of
these leeches is looked upon as pretty much the same as that
of the cupping-glasses<a id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> used in medicine, their effect being to
relieve the body of superfluous blood, and to open the pores of
the skin. Still, however, there is this inconvenience attending
them‚Äîwhen they have been once applied, they create a
necessity<a id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> for having recourse to the same treatment at about
the same period in every succeeding year. Many physicians
have been of opinion also, that leeches may be successfully applied
in cases of gout. When gorged, they fall off in consequence
of losing their hold through the weight of the blood,
but if not, they must be sprinkled with salt<a id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> for the purpose.</p>

<p>Leeches are apt, however, to leave their heads buried in the
flesh; the consequence of which is an incurable wound, which
has caused death in many cases, that of Messalinus,<a id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> for example,
a patrician of consular rank, after an application of
leeches to his knee. When this is the case, that which was
intended as a remedy is turned into an active poison;<a id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> a result
which is to be apprehended in using the red leeches more
particularly. Hence it is that when these last are employed,
it is the practice to snip them with a pair of scissors while
sucking; the consequence of which is, that the blood oozes
forth, through a siphon, as it were, and the head, gradually
contracting as the animal dies, is not left behind in the wound.
There is a natural antipathy<a id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> existing between leeches and
bugs, and hence it is that the latter are killed by the aid
of a fumigation made with leeches. Ashes of beaver-skin
burnt with tar, kneaded up with leek-juice, arrest bleeding at
the nostrils.</p>

with heads of cunila<a id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> and olive-oil. Ashes of sea-crabs, calcined
with lead, arrest the progress of carcinomatous sores; a
purpose for which ashes of river-crabs, in combination with
honey and fine lint, are equally useful: though there are some
authorities which prefer mixing alum and barley with the
ashes. Phaged√¶nic ulcers are cured by an application of
dried silurus pounded with sandarach;<a id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> malignant cancers,

flesh in the course of a day, and will arrest the further progress
of putrid and serpiginous ulcers. Alex,<a id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> applied in

Lint greased with dolphin‚Äôs<a id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> fat, and then ignited,

strombi,<a id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> left to putrefy in vinegar. Heads of perch or of

curative of diseases of the uterus: used as a fumigation, they
bring away the afterbirth. Fat,<a id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> too, of the sea-calf, melted
by the agency of fire, is introduced into the nostrils of females
when swooning from hysterical suffocations; and for a similar
purpose, the rennet of that animal is applied as a pessary, in
wool.</p>

<p>The pulmo marinus,<a id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> attached to the body as an amulet, is
an excellent promoter of menstruation; an effect which is
equally produced by pounding live sea-urchins, and taking
them in sweet wine. River-crabs,<a id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> bruised in wine, and taken
internally, arrest menstruation. The silurus,<a id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> that of Africa<a id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a>
more particularly, used as a fumigation, facilitates parturition,
it is said. Crabs, taken in water, arrest menstruation; but
used with hyssop, they act as an emmenagogue, we are told.
In cases, too, where the infant is in danger of suffocation at
the moment of delivery, a similar drink, administered to the
mother, is highly efficacious. Crabs, too, either fresh or dried,
are taken in drink, for the purpose of preventing abortion.
Hippocrates<a id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> prescribes them as a promoter of menstruation,
and as an expellent of the dead f≈ìtus, beaten up with five<a id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a>
roots of lapathum and rue and some soot, and administered
in honied wine. Crabs, boiled and taken in their liquor,
with lapathum<a id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> and parsley, promote the menstrual discharge,
and increase the milk. In cases of fever, attended
with pains in the head and throbbing of the eyes, crabs are
said to be highly beneficial to females, given in astringent
wine.</p>

<p>Castoreum,<a id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> taken in honied wine, is useful as a promoter
of menstruation: in cases of hysterical suffocation, it is given
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>to the patient to smell at with pitch and vinegar, or else it is
made up into tablets and used as a pessary. For the purpose
also of bringing away the afterbirth it is found a useful plan
to employ castoreum with panax,<a id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> in four cyathi of wine;
and in cases where the patient is suffering from cold, in doses
of three oboli. If, however, a female in a state of pregnancy
should happen to step over castoreum, or over the beaver itself,
abortion, it is said, will be the sure result: so, too, if castoreum
is only held over a pregnant woman‚Äôs head, there will be
great danger of miscarriage.</p>

<p>There is a very marvellous fact, too, that I find stated in
reference to the torpedo:<a id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> if it is caught at the time that the
moon is in Libra, and kept in the open air for three days, it
will always facilitate parturition, as often as it is introduced
into the apartment of a woman in labour. The sting, too, of
the pastinaca,<a id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> attached to the navel, is generally thought to
have the property of facilitating delivery: it must be taken,
however, from the fish while alive; which done, the fish must
be returned to the sea. I find it stated by some authorities that
there is a substance called ‚Äúostraceum,‚Äù which is also spoken
of as ‚Äúonyx‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> by others; that, used as a fumigation, it is
wonderfully beneficial for suffocations of the uterus; that in
smell it resembles castoreum, and is still more efficacious, if
burnt with this last substance; and that in a calcined state it
has the property of healing inveterate ulcers, and cancerous
sores of a malignant nature. As to carbuncles and carcinomatous
sores upon the secret parts of females, there is nothing
more efficacious, it is said, than a female crab beaten up, just
after full moon, with flower of salt<a id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> and applied with water.</p>

to the pulmo marinus,<a id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> to the blood and gall of the sea-hare,
and to the sea-hare itself, stifled in oil. The same, too, with

applied with alum on the sixteenth day of the moon.
The thick matter emitted by the small frogs, which we have
described when treating<a id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> of eye-diseases, is a most efficient
depilatory, if applied fresh: the same, too, with the frog itself,
dried and pounded, and then boiled down to one-third in three
hemin√¶ of water, or else boiled in a copper vessel with oil in a
like proportion. Others, again, prepare a depilatory from fifteen
frogs, in manner already<a id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> stated under the head of remedies
for the eyes. Leeches, also, grilled in an earthen vessel, and
applied with vinegar, have the same property as a depilatory;
the very odour, too, which attaches to the persons who thus burn
them is singularly efficacious for killing bugs.<a id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> Cases are to be
found, too, where persons have used castoreum with honey,
for many days together, as a depilatory. In the case, however,
of every depilatory, the hairs should always be removed before
it is applied.</p>

<p>Dentition in infants is promoted, and the gums greatly relieved,

CHAP. 52.‚ÄîOTHER AQUATIC PRODUCTIONS. ADARCA OR CALAMOCHNOS:
THREE REMEDIES. REEDS: EIGHT REMEDIES. THE
INK OF THE S√ÜPIA.</span></h3></div>

<p>Among the aquatic productions ought also to be mentioned
calamochnos, in Latin known as ‚Äúadarca,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> a substance which
collects about small reeds, from a mixture of the foam of fresh
and of sea water. It possesses certain caustic properties, and
hence it is that it is so useful as an ingredient in ‚Äúacopa‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a>
and as a remedy for cold shiverings; it is used too, for removing
freckles upon the face of females. And now we are
speaking of adarca, the reed ought equally to be mentioned. The
root of that known as the ‚Äúphragmites,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> pounded fresh, is
curative of sprains, and, applied topically with vinegar, removes
pains in the spine. The calcined bark, too, of the
Cyprian<a id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> reed, known as the ‚Äúdonax,‚Äù is curative of alopecy
and inveterate ulcers; and its leaves are good for the extraction
of foreign bodies adhering to the flesh, and for the cure
of erysipelas: should, however, the flower of the panicle happen
to enter the ears, deafness<a id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> is the consequence.</p>

<p>The ink of the s√¶pia<a id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> is possessed of such remarkable potency,
that if it is put into a lamp, Anaxila√ºs tells us, the light
will become entirely changed,<a id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> and all present will look
as black as √Üthiopians. The bramble-frog, boiled in water,
and given to swine with their drink, is curative of the maladies
with which they are affected; an effect equally produced by
the ashes of any other kind of frog. If wood is rubbed with
the pulmo marinus,<a id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> it will have all the appearance of being

CHAP. 53. (11.)‚ÄîTHE NAMES OF ALL THE ANIMALS THAT EXIST
IN THE SEA, ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-SIX IN NUMBER.</span></h3></div>

<p>Having now completed our exposition of the properties which
belong to the aquatic productions, it would appear by no means
foreign to my purpose to give a list of the various animated
beings which inhabit the seas; so many as these are in number,
of such vast extent, and not only making their way into
the interior of the land to a distance of so many miles, but also
surrounding the exterior of it to an extent almost equal to that
of the world itself. These animals, it is generally considered,
embrace one hundred and seventy-six different<a id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> species, and it
will be my object to set them forth, each by its distinct name,
a thing that cannot possibly be done in reference to the terrestrial
animals and the birds.</p>

<p>For, in fact, we are by no means acquainted with all the
wild beasts or all the birds that are to be found in India, √Üthiopia,
Scythia, or the desert regions of the earth; and even of
man himself there are numerous varieties, which as yet we
have been unable<a id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> to make ourselves acquainted with. In addition,
too, to the various countries above mentioned, we have
Taprobane<a id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> and other isles of the Ocean, about which so many
fabulous stories are related. Surely then, every one must allow
that it is quite impossible to comprise every species of animal in
one general view for the information of mankind. And yet, by
Hercules! in the sea and in the Ocean, vast as it is, there exists
nothing that is unknown to us,<a id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> and, a truly marvellous fact,
it is with those things which Nature has concealed in the deep
that we are the best acquainted!</p>

CHAP. 54.‚ÄîADDITIONAL NAMES OF FISHES FOUND IN THE POEM
OF OVID.</span></h3></div>

<p>To the above enumeration we will add some names given in
the poem of Ovid,<a id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> which are not to be found in any other
writer: species, however, which are probably peculiar to the
Euxine, on the shores<a id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> of which he commenced that work
towards the close of his life. The fishes thus mentioned by
him are the sea-ox, the cercyrus, that dwells among the rocks,
the orphus,<a id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> the red erythinus,<a id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> the iulus,<a id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> the tinted mormyr,
the chrysophrys<a id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> a fish of a golden colour, the parus,<a id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">618</a>
the tragus,<a id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> the melanurus<a id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> remarkable for the beauty of its
tail, and the epodes,<a id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> a flat fish.</p>

<p>In addition to these remarkable kinds of fishes, the same
poet tells us that the channes<a id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> conceives of itself, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>glaucus<a id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> never makes its appearance in summer, that the pompilus<a id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">624</a>
always accompanies vessels in their course, and that
the chromis<a id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> makes its nest in the water. The helops, he
says, is unknown to our waters; from which it would appear
that those are in error who look upon it as identical with our
acipenser.<a id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> Many persons have given the preference to the
helops before all other fish, in point of flavour.</p>

<p>There are several fishes also, which have been mentioned by
no author; such, for instance, as the one called ‚Äúsudis‚Äù by
the Latins, and ‚Äúsphyrene‚Äù by the Greeks, names which indicate
the peculiar form of its muzzle.<a id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">627</a> It is one of the very
largest kinds, but rarely found, and by no means of inferior
flavour. ‚ÄúPerna,‚Äù too, is the name given to a kind of shell-fish,
found in vast numbers in the vicinity of the islands of the
Euxine. These fish are found firmly planted in the sand, resembling
in appearance the long shank<a id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> of a hog. Opening
wide their shells, where there is sufficient space, they lie in
wait for their prey; this opening being not less than a foot in
breadth, and the edges of it garnished around with teeth
closely set, much resembling the teeth of a comb in form.
Within the shell, the meat consists of a vast lump of flesh.
I once saw, too, a fish called the ‚Äúhy√¶na,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> which had been
caught off the island of √Ünaria.<a id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">630</a></p>

<p>In addition to these animals, there are certain excretions
thrown up by the sea, which do not merit any further notice,
and indeed ought to be reckoned among the sea-weeds, rather
than looked upon as animated beings.</p>

the standard of comparative value, objects for which we diligently
search, within the earth, in numerous ways. In one
place, for instance, we undermine it for the purpose of obtaining
riches, to supply the exigencies of life, searching for either
gold or silver, electrum<a id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">649</a> or copper.<a id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> In another place, to
satisfy the requirements of luxury, our researches extend to
gems and pigments, with which to adorn our fingers<a id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> and the
walls of our houses: while in a third place, we gratify our
rash propensities by a search for iron, which, amid wars and
carnage, is deemed more acceptable even than gold. We trace
out all the veins of the earth, and yet, living upon it, undermined
as it is beneath our feet, are astonished that it should occasionally
cleave asunder or tremble: as though, forsooth, these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>signs could be any other than expressions of the indignation
felt by our sacred parent! We penetrate into her entrails, and
seek for treasures in the abodes even of the Manes,<a id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> as though
each spot we tread upon were not sufficiently bounteous and
fertile for us!</p>

<p>And yet, amid all this, we are far from making remedies the
object of our researches: and how few in thus delving into the
earth have in view the promotion of medicinal knowledge! For
it is upon her surface, in fact, that she has presented us with
these substances, equally with the cereals, bounteous and ever
ready, as she is, in supplying us with all things for our benefit!
It is what is concealed from our view, what is sunk far beneath
her surface, objects, in fact, of no rapid formation,<a id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> that
urge us to our ruin, that send us to the very depths of hell.
As the mind ranges in vague speculation, let us only consider,
proceeding through all ages, as these operations are, when will
be the end of thus exhausting the earth, and to what point
will avarice finally penetrate! How innocent, how happy, how
truly delightful even would life be, if we were to desire nothing
but what is to be found upon the face of the earth; in a
word, nothing but what is provided ready to our hands!</p>

chrysocolla,<a id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> a substance which, that it may appear all the
more precious, still retains the name<a id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> which it has borrowed
from gold.<a id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> It was not enough for us to have discovered one
bane for the human race, but we must set a value too upon the
very humours of gold.<a id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> While avarice, too, was on the search
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>for silver, it congratulated itself upon the discovery of minium,<a id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">658</a>
and devised a use to be made of this red earth.</p>

<p>Alas for the prodigal inventions of man! in how many
ways have we augmented the value of things!<a id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> In addition
to the standard value of these metals, the art of painting lends
its aid, and we have rendered gold and silver still more costly
by the art of chasing them. Man has learned how to challenge
both Nature and art to become the incitements to vice! His
very cups he has delighted to engrave with libidinous subjects,
and he takes pleasure in drinking from vessels of obscene form!<a id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">660</a>
But in lapse of time, the metals passed out of fashion, and
men began to make no account of them; gold and silver, in
fact, became too common. From this same earth we have extracted
vessels of murrhine<a id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">661</a> and vases of crystal,<a id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">662</a> objects
the very fragility of which is considered to enhance their value.
In fact, it has come to be looked upon as a proof of opulence,
and as quite the glory of luxury, to possess that which may be
irremediably destroyed in an instant. Nor was even this
enough;‚Äîwe now drink from out of a mass of gems,<a id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> and we
set our goblets with smaragdi;<a id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> we take delight in possessing
the wealth of India, as the promoter of intoxication, and gold
is now nothing more than a mere accessory.<a id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">665</a></p>

CHAP. 3.‚ÄîWHAT WAS THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION OF GOLD.</span></h3></div>

<p>Would that gold could have been banished for ever from
the earth, accursed by universal report,<a id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> as some of the most
celebrated writers have expressed themselves, reviled by the
reproaches of the best of men, and looked upon as discovered
only for the ruin of mankind. How much more happy the
age when things themselves were bartered for one another; as
was the case in the times of the Trojan war, if we are to believe
what Homer says. For, in this way, in my opinion, was
commerce then carried on for the supply of the necessaries of
life. Some, he tells us, would make their purchases by bartering
ox-hides, and others by bartering iron or the spoil which they
had taken from the enemy:<a id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> and yet he himself, already an
admirer of gold, was so far aware of the relative value of things,
that Glaucus, he informs us, exchanged his arms of gold, valued
at one hundred oxen, for those of Diomedes, which were worth
but nine.<a id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> Proceeding upon the same system of barter, many
of the fines imposed by ancient laws, at Rome even, were
levied in cattle,<a id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">669</a> [and not in money].</p>

CHAP. 4.‚ÄîTHE ORIGIN OF GOLD RINGS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The worst crime against mankind was committed by him
who was the first to put a ring upon his fingers: and yet we
are not informed, by tradition, who it was that first did so. For
as to all the stories told about Prometheus, I look upon them as
utterly fabulous, although I am aware that the ancients used
to represent him with a ring of iron: it was their intention,
however, to signify a chain thereby, and not an ornament.
As to the ring of Midas,<a id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> which, upon the collet being turned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>inwards, conferred invisibility upon the wearer, who is there
that must not admit, perforce, that this story is even still
more fabulous? It was the hand, and a sinister<a id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> hand, too, in
every sense, that first brought gold into such high repute: not
a Roman hand, however, for upon that it was the practice to
wear a ring of iron only, and solely as an indication of warlike
prowess.</p>

<p>As to the usage followed by the Roman kings, it is not easy
to pronounce an opinion: the statue of Romulus in the Capitol
wears no ring, nor does any other statue‚Äînot that of L. Brutus
even‚Äîwith the sole exception of those of Numa and Servius
Tullius. I am surprised at this absence of the ring, in the
case of the Tarquinii more particularly, seeing that they were
originally from Greece,<a id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> a country from which the use of
gold rings was first introduced; though even at the present
day the people of Laced√¶mon are in the habit of wearing rings
made of iron. Tarquinius Priscus, however, it is well known,
was the first who presented his son with the golden bulla,<a id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> on
the occasion of his slaying an enemy before he had laid aside the
pr√¶texta;<a id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">674</a> from which period the custom of wearing the bulla
has been continued, a distinction confined to the children of
those who have served in the cavalry, those of other persons
simply wearing a leather thong.<a id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> Such being the case, I am
the more surprised that the statue of this Tarquinius should
be without a ring.</p>

<p>And yet, with reference to the very name of the ring, I find
that there has been considerable uncertainty. That given to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>it originally by the Greeks is derived from the finger;<a id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> while
our ancestors styled it ‚Äúungulus;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> and in later times both
Greeks and Latins have given it the name of ‚Äúsymbolum.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">678</a>
For a great length of time, it is quite clear, not even the
Roman senators wore rings of gold: for rings were given, and
at the public expense, to those only who were about to proceed
on an embassy to foreign nations, the reason being, I suppose,
because men of highest rank among foreign nations were perceived
to be thus distinguished. Nor was it the practice for
any person to wear these rings, except those who for this reason
had received them at the public expense; and in most instances,
it was without this distinction that the Roman generals
celebrated their public triumphs.<a id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> For whereas an Etruscan
crown<a id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> of gold was supported from behind over the head of
the victor, he himself, equally with the slave probably, who
was so supporting the crown, had nothing but a ring of
iron upon his finger.<a id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> It was in this manner that C. Marius
celebrated his triumph over Jugurtha; and he never assumed<a id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">682</a>
the golden ring, it is said, until the period of his
third consulship.<a id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> Those, too, who had received golden rings
on the occasion of an embassy, only wore them when in public,
resuming the ring of iron when in their houses. It is in pursuance
of this custom that even at the present day, an iron
ring<a id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> is sent by way of present to a woman when betrothed,
and that, too, without any stone in it.</p>

<p>For my own part, I do not find that any rings were used in
the days of the Trojan War; at all events, Homer nowhere
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>makes mention of them; for although he speaks of the practice
of sending tablets<a id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> by way of letter,<a id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">686</a> of clothes and gold and
silver plate being kept laid up in chests,<a id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> still he gives us to
understand that they were kept secure by the aid of a knot
tied fast, and not under a seal impressed by a ring. He does
not inform us too, that when the chiefs drew lots to ascertain
which one of them should reply to the challenge<a id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> of the
enemy, they made any use of rings<a id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">689</a> for the purpose; and when
he enumerates the articles that were manufactured at the
forge<a id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> of the gods, he speaks of this as being the origin<a id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> of
fibul√¶<a id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">692</a> and other articles of female ornament, such as ear-rings
for example, but does not make any mention of rings.
<a id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">693</a>
Whoever it was that first introduced the use of rings, he
did so not without hesitation; for he placed this ornament on
the left hand, the hand which is generally concealed,<a id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> whereas,
if he had been sure of its being an honourable distinction, it
would have been made more conspicuous upon the right. And if
any one should raise the objection that this would have acted
as an impediment to the right hand, I can only say that the
usage in more recent times fortifies my opinion, and that the
inconvenience of wearing rings on the left hand would have
been still greater, seeing that it is with the left hand that the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>shield is held. We find mention made too, in Homer,<a id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> of men
wearing gold plaited with the hair; and hence it is that I am
at a loss to say whether the practice first originated with
females.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_5"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 5.‚ÄîTHE QUANTITY OF GOLD POSSESSED BY THE ANCIENTS.</span></h3></div>

<p>At Rome, for a long period of time, the quantity of gold
was but very small. At all events, after the capture of the
City by the Gauls, when peace was about to be purchased, not
more than one thousand pounds‚Äô weight of gold could be collected.
I am by no means unaware of the fact that in the
third<a id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> consulship of Pompeius there was lost from the throne
of Jupiter Capitolinus two thousand pounds‚Äô weight of gold,
originally placed there by Camillus; a circumstance which has
led most persons to suppose, that two thousand pounds‚Äô weight
was the quantity then collected. But in reality, this excess
of one thousand pounds was contributed from the spoil taken
from the Gauls, amplified as it was by the gold of which they
had stripped the temples, in that part of the City which they
had captured.</p>

<p>The story of Torquatus,<a id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> too, is a proof that the Gauls were
in the habit of wearing ornaments of gold when engaged in
combat;<a id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> from which it would appear that the sum taken
from the Gauls themselves, and the amount of which they had
pillaged the temples, were only equal to the amount of gold
collected for the ransom, and no more; and this is what was
really meant by the response given by the augurs, that Jupiter
Capitolinus had rendered again the ransom twofold.<a id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> As we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>were just now speaking on the subject of rings, it may be as
well to add, by way of passing remark, that upon the officer<a id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">700</a>
in charge of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus being arrested,
he broke the stone of his ring between his teeth,<a id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">701</a> and expired
upon the spot, thus putting an end to all possibility of discovering
the perpetrator of the theft.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that in the year of the City 364, when
Rome was captured by the Gauls, there was but two thousand
pounds‚Äô weight of gold, at the very most; and this, too, at a
period when, according to the returns of the census, there were
already one hundred and fifty-two thousand five hundred and
seventy-three free citizens in it. In this same city, too, three
hundred and seven years later, the gold which C. Marius the
younger<a id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> conveyed to Pr√¶sneste from the Temple of the Capitol
when in flames, and all the other shrines, amounted to thirteen
thousand pounds‚Äô weight, such being the sum that figured in the
inscriptions at the triumph of Sylla; on which occasion it was
displayed in the procession, as well as six thousand pounds‚Äô
weight of silver. The same Sylla had, the day before, displayed
in his triumph fifteen thousand pounds‚Äô weight of gold,
and one hundred and fifteen thousand pounds‚Äô weight of silver,
the fruit of all his other victories.</p>

CHAP. 6.‚ÄîTHE RIGHT OF WEARING GOLD RINGS.</span></h3></div>

<p>It does not appear that rings were in common use before the
time of Cneius Flavius, the son of Annius. This Flavius was
the first to publish a table<a id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> of the days for pleading,<a id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> which
till then the populace had to ascertain each day from a few
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>great personages.<a id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> The son of a freedman only, and secretary
to Appius C√¶cus,<a id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> (at whose request, by dint of natural shrewdness
and continual observation, he had selected these days and
made them public),<a id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> he obtained such high favour with the
people, that he was created curule √¶dile; in conjunction with
Quintus Anicius Pr√¶nestinus, who a few years before had been
an enemy to Rome,<a id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> and to the exclusion of C. P≈ìtilius and
Domitius, whose fathers respectively were of consular rank.<a id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">709</a>
The additional honour was also conferred on Flavius, of making
him tribune of the people at the same time, a thing which occasioned
such a degree of indignation, that, as we find stated in
the more ancient Annals, ‚Äúthe rings<a id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> were laid aside!‚Äù</p>

<p>Most persons, however, are mistaken in the supposition that
on this occasion the members of the equestrian order did the
same: for it is in consequence of these additional words, ‚Äúthe
phaler√¶,<a id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> too, were laid aside as well,‚Äù that the name of the
equestrian order was added. These rings, too, as the Annals
tell us, were laid aside by the nobility, and not<a id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> by the whole
body of the senate. This event took place in the consulship
of P. Sempronius and P. Sulpicius.<a id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> Flavius made a vow
that he would consecrate a temple to Concord, if he should
succeed in reconciling the privileged orders with the plebeians:
and as no part of the public funds could be voted for the purpose,
he accordingly built a small shrine of brass<a id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">714</a> in the Gr√¶costasis,<a id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">715</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>then situate above the Comitium,<a id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> with the fines
which had been exacted for usury. Here, too, he had an inscription
engraved upon a tablet of brass, to the effect that the
shrine was dedicated two hundred and three years after the
consecration of the Capitol. Such were the events that happened
four hundred and forty-nine years after the foundation
of the City, this being the earliest period at which we find
any traces of the common use of rings.</p>

<p>A second occasion, however, that of the Second Punic War,
shows that rings must have been at that period in very general
use; for if such had not been the case, it would have been
impossible for Hannibal to send the three<a id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> modii of rings, which
we find so much spoken of, to Carthage. It was through a
dispute, too, at an auction about the possession of a ring, that
the feud first commenced between C√¶pio<a id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">718</a> and Drusus,<a id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> a dispute
which gave rise to the Social War,<a id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">720</a> and the public disasters
which thence ensued. Not even in those days, however,
did all the senators possess gold rings, seeing that, in the
memory of our grandsires, many personages who had even
filled the pr√¶torship, wore rings of iron to the end of their
lives; Calpurnius,<a id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> for example, as Fenestella tells us, and
Manilius, who had been legatus to Caius Marius in the Jugurthine
War. Many historians also state the same of L.
Fufidius, he to whom Scaurus dedicated the history of his
life.</p>

<p>In the family of the Quintii,<a id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">722</a> it is the usage for no one, not
the females even, ever to wear a ring; and even at the present
day, the greater part of the nations known to us, peoples
who are living under the Roman sway, are not in the habit of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>wearing rings. Neither in the countries of the East,<a id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> nor
in Egypt, is any use made of seals, the people being content
with simple writing only.<a id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">724</a></p>

<p>In this, as in every other case, luxury has introduced various
fashions, either by adding to rings gems of exquisite brilliancy,
and so loading the fingers with whole revenues, as we shall
have further occasion to mention in our Book on Gems;<a id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> or
else by engraving them with various devices: so that it is in
one instance the workmanship, in another the material, that
constitutes the real value of the ring. Then again, in the
case of other gems, luxury has deemed it no less than sacrilege
to make a mark<a id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> even upon them, and has caused them to be set
whole, that no one may suppose that the ring was ever intended
to be employed as a signet. In other instances, luxury has
willed that certain stones, on the side even that is concealed by
the finger, should not<a id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">727</a> be closed in with gold, thus making
gold of less account than thousands of tiny pebbles. On the
other hand again, many persons will admit of no gems being
set in their rings, but impress their seal with the gold<a id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> itself,
an invention which dates from the reign of Claudius C√¶sar.
At the present day, too, the very slaves even, incase their iron
rings with gold (while other articles belonging to them, they
decorate with pure gold),<a id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">729</a> a licence which first originated in
the Isle of Samothrace,<a id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> as the name given to the invention
clearly shows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>It was the custom at first to wear rings on a single finger<a id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">731</a>
only, the one, namely, that is next to the little finger; and this
we see the case in the statues of Numa and Servius Tullius.
In later times, it became the practice to put rings on the finger
next to the thumb, even in the case of the statues of the gods;
and more recently, again, it has been the fashion to wear them
upon the little finger<a id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">732</a> as well. Among the peoples of Gallia
and Britannia, the middle finger, it is said, is used for this purpose.
At the present day, however, among us, this is the only
finger that is excepted, all the others being loaded with rings,
smaller rings even being separately adapted for the smaller
joints of the fingers. Some there are who heap several rings
upon the little finger alone; while others, again, wear but one
ring upon this finger, the ring that sets a seal upon the signet-ring
itself, this last being kept carefully shut up as an object
of rarity, too precious to be worn in common use, and only to
be taken from the cabinet<a id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> as from a sanctuary. And thus is
the wearing of a single ring upon the little finger no more
than an ostentatious advertisement that the owner has property
of a more precious nature under seal at home!</p>

<p>Some, too, make a parade of the weight of their rings, while
to others it is quite a labour<a id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">734</a> to wear more than one at a time:
some, in their solicitude for the safety of their gems, make the
hoop of gold tinsel, and fill it with a lighter material than gold,
thinking thereby to diminish the risks of a fall.<a id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">735</a> Others, again,
are in the habit of inclosing poisons beneath the stones of
their rings, and so wear them as instruments of death; Demosthenes,
for instance, that greatest of the orators of Greece.<a id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">736</a>
And then, besides, how many of the crimes that are stimulated
by cupidity, are committed through the instrumentality of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>rings!<a id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> How happy the times, how truly innocent, in which
no seal was ever put to anything! At the present day, on the
contrary, our very food even and our drink have to be preserved
from theft<a id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> through the agency of the ring: a result owing to
those legions of slaves, those throngs of foreigners which are
introduced into our houses, multitudes so numerous that we
require the services of a nomenclator<a id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">739</a> even, to tell us the
names of our own servants. Very different was it in the times
of our forefathers, when each person possessed a single servant
only, one of his master‚Äôs own lineage, called Marcipor or
Lucipor,<a id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">740</a> from his master‚Äôs name, as the case might be, and
taking all his meals with him in common; when, too, there
was no occasion for taking precautions at home by keeping a
watch upon the domestics. But at the present day, we not
only procure dainties which are sure to be pilfered, but hands
to pilfer them as well; and so far is it from being sufficient to
have the very keys sealed, that the signet-ring is often taken
from off the owner‚Äôs finger while he is overpowered with sleep
or lying on his death-bed.<a id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">741</a></p>

<p>Indeed the most important transactions of life are now made
to depend upon this instrument, though at what period this first
began to be the case, I am at a loss to say. It would appear,
however, so far as foreign nations are concerned, that we may
admit the importance attached to it, from the days of Polycrates,<a id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">742</a>
the tyrant of Samos, whose favourite ring, after being
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>thrown in the sea, was recovered from a fish that was caught;
and this Polycrates, we know, was put to death<a id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> about the
year of our City, 230. The use of the ring must, of necessity,
have become greatly extended with the increase of usury;
one proof of which is, the usage still prevalent among the
lower classes, of whipping off the ring<a id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">744</a> the moment a simple
contract is made; a practice which takes its date, no doubt,
from a period when there was no more expeditious method of
giving an earnest on closing a bargain. We may therefore
very safely conclude, that though money was first introduced
among us, the use of rings was introduced very shortly after.
Of money, I shall shortly have occasion to speak further.<a id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">745</a></p>

CHAP. 7.‚ÄîTHE DECURIES OF THE JUDGES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Rings, as soon as they began to be commonly worn, distinguished
the second order from the plebeians, in the same
manner as the use of the tunic<a id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">746</a> distinguished the senate from
those who only wore the ring. Still, however, this last distinction
was introduced at a later period only, and we find it
stated by writers that the public heralds<a id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">747</a> even were formerly
in the habit of wearing the tunic with the purple laticlave;
the father of Lucius √Ülius Stilo,<a id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">748</a> for instance, from whom
his son received the cognomen of ‚ÄúPr√¶coninus,‚Äù in consequence
of his father‚Äôs occupation as a herald. But the use of
rings, no doubt, was the distinguishing mark of a third and
intermediate order, between the plebeians and the senators;
and the title of ‚Äúeques,‚Äù originally derived from the possession
of a war-horse,<a id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> is given at the present day as an indication
of a certain amount of income. This, however, is of
comparatively recent introduction; for when the late Emperor
Augustus made his regulations for the decuries,<a id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">750</a> the greater
part of the members thereof were persons who wore iron rings,
and these bore the name, not of ‚Äúequites,‚Äù but of ‚Äújudices,‚Äù
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>the former name being reserved solely for the members of the
squadrons<a id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">751</a> furnished with war-horses at the public charge.</p>

<p>Of these judices, too, there were at first but four<a id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">752</a> decuries
only, and in each of these decuries there was hardly one thousand
men to be found, the provinces not having been hitherto
admitted to the office; an observance which is still in force at
the present day, no one newly admitted to the rights of citizenship
being allowed to perform the duties of judex as a member
of the decuries.</p>

<p>(2.) These decuries, too, were themselves distinguished by
several denominations‚Äî‚Äútribunes<a id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> of the treasury,‚Äù ‚Äúselecti,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">754</a>
and ‚Äújudices:‚Äù in addition to whom, there were the persons
styled the ‚Äúnine hundred,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> chosen from all the decuries for
the purpose of keeping the voting-boxes at the comitia. From
the ambitious adoption, however, of some one of these names,
great divisions ensued in this order, one person styling himself
a member of the nine hundred, another one of the selecti, and
a third a tribune of the treasury.</p>

CHAP. 8.‚ÄîPARTICULARS CONNECTED WITH THE EQUESTRIAN ORDER.</span></h3></div>

<p>At length, however, in the ninth<a id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">756</a> year of the reign of the
Emperor Tiberius, the equestrian order was united in a single
body; and a decree was passed, establishing to whom belonged
the right of wearing the ring, in the consulship of C. Asinius
Pollio and C. Antistius Vetus, the year from the foundation of the
City, 775. It is a matter for surprise, how almost futile, we
may say, was the cause which led to this change. C. Sulpicius
Galba,<a id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">757</a> desirous in his youth to establish his credit with the
Emperor by hunting<a id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> out grounds for prosecuting<a id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> the keepers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>of victualling-houses, made complaint in the senate that the
proprietors of those places were in the habit of protecting
themselves from the consequences of their guilt by their plea
of wearing the golden ring.<a id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> For this reason, an ordinance
was made that no person whatsoever should have this right of
wearing the ring, unless, freeborn himself as regarded his
father and paternal grandfather, he should be assessed by the
censors at four hundred thousand sesterces, and entitled, under
the Julian Law,<a id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> to sit in the fourteen tiers of seats at the
theatre. In later times, however, people began to apply in
whole crowds for this mark of rank; and in consequence of
the diversities of opinion which were occasioned thereby, the
Emperor Caius<a id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">762</a> added a fifth decury to the number. Indeed
to such a pitch has conceit now arisen, that whereas, under the
late Emperor Augustus, the decuries could not be completed,
at the present day they will not suffice to receive all the members
of the equestrian order, and we see in every quarter persons
even who have been but just liberated from slavery, making
a leap all at once to the distinction of the golden ring: a thing
that never used to happen in former days, as it was by the
ring of iron that the equites and the judices were then to be
recognized.</p>

<p>Indeed, so promiscuously was this privilege at last conferred,
that Flavius Proculus, one of the equites, informed against
four hundred persons on this ground, before the Emperor Claudius,
who was then censor:<a id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> and thus we see, an order, which
was established as a mark of distinction from other private individuals
of free birth, has been shared in common with slaves!</p>

<p>The Gracchi were the first to attach to this order the separate
appellation of ‚Äújudices,‚Äù their object being at the same moment
a seditious popularity and the humiliation of the senate. After
the fall of these men, in consequence of the varying results of
seditious movements, the name and influence of the equestrian
order were lost, and became merged in those of the publicani,<a id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">764</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>who, for some time, were the men that constituted the third
class in the state. At last, however, Marcus Cicero, during
his consulship, and at the period of the Catilinarian troubles,
re-established the equestrian name, it being his vaunt that he
himself had sprung from that order, and he, by certain acts of
popularity peculiar to himself, having conciliated its support.
Since that period, it is very clear that the equites have formed
the third body in the state, and the name of the equestrian order
has been added to the formula‚Äî‚ÄúThe Senate and People of
Rome.‚Äù Hence<a id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> it is, too, that at the present day even, the
name of this order is written after that of the people, it being
the one that was the last instituted.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_9"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 9.‚ÄîHOW OFTEN THE NAME OF THE EQUESTRIAN ORDER
HAS BEEN CHANGED.</span></h3></div>

<p>Indeed, the name itself of the equites even, has been frequently
changed, and that too, in the case of those who only
owed their name to the fact of their service on horseback.
Under Romulus and the other kings, the equites were known
as ‚ÄúCeleres,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> then again as ‚ÄúFlexuntes,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> and after that
as ‚ÄúTrossuli,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> from the fact of their having taken a certain
town of Etruria, situate nine miles on this side of Volsinii,
without any assistance from the infantry; a name too which
survived till after the death of C. Gracchus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>At all events, in the writings left by Junius, who, from his
affection for C. Gracchus, took the name of Gracchanus,<a id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">769</a> we
find the following words‚Äî‚ÄúAs regards the equestrian order,
its members were formerly called ‚ÄòTrossuli,‚Äô but at the
present day they have the name of ‚ÄòEquites;‚Äô because it is
not understood what the appellation ‚ÄòTrossuli‚Äô really means,
and many feel ashamed at being called by that name.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">770</a>‚ÄîHe<a id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">771</a>
then goes on to explain the reason, as above mentioned, and
adds that, though much against their will, those persons are
still called ‚ÄúTrossuli.‚Äù</p>

CHAP. 10.‚ÄîGIFTS FOR MILITARY SERVICES, IN GOLD AND SILVER.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are also some other distinctions connected with gold,
the mention of which ought not to be omitted. Our ancestors,
for instance, presented torcs<a id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> of gold to the auxiliaries and
foreign troops, while to Roman citizens they only granted
silver<a id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> ones: bracelets<a id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> too, were given by them to citizens,
but never to foreigners.</p>

CHAP. 11.‚ÄîAT WHAT PERIOD THE FIRST CROWN OF GOLD WAS

<p>But, a thing that is more surprising still, crowns<a id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> of gold
were given to the citizens as well. As to the person who was
first presented with one, so far as I have enquired, I have not
been able to ascertain his name: L. Piso says, however, that
the Dictator<a id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> A. Posthumius was the first who conferred one:
on taking the camp of the Latins at Lake Regillus,<a id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">777</a> he gave
a crown of gold, made from the spoil, to the soldier whose
valour had mainly contributed to this success. L. Lentulus,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>also, when consul,<a id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">778</a> presented one to Servius Cornelius Merenda,
on taking a town of the Samnites; but in his case it was five
pounds in weight. Piso Frugi, too, presented his son with a
golden crown, at his own private expense, making<a id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> it a specific
legacy in his will.</p>

CHAP. 12. (3.)‚ÄîOTHER USES MADE OF GOLD, BY FEMALES.</span></h3></div>

<p>To honour the gods at their sacrifices, no greater mark of
honour has been thought of than to gild the horns of the animals
sacrificed‚Äîthat is, of the larger victims<a id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> only. But in warfare,
this species of luxury made such rapid advances, that in the
Epistles of M. Brutus from the Plains of Philippi, we find expressions
of indignation at the fibul√¶<a id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> of gold that were worn
by the tribunes. Yes, so it is, by Hercules! and yet you, the
same Brutus, have not said a word about women wearing gold
upon their feet; while we, on the other hand, charge him with
criminality<a id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> who was the first to confer dignity upon gold by
wearing the ring. Let men even, at the present day, wear gold
upon the arms in form of bracelets‚Äîknown as ‚Äúdardania,‚Äù
because the practice first originated in Dardania, and called
‚Äúviriol√¶‚Äù in the language of the Celts, ‚Äúviri√¶‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> in that of
Celtiberia, let women wear gold upon their arms<a id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> and
all their fingers, their necks, their ears, the tresses of their
hair; let chains of gold run meandering along their sides;
and in the still hours of the night let sachets filled with pearls
hang suspended from the necks of their mistresses, all bedizened
with gold, so that in their very sleep even they may still
retain the consciousness that they are the possessors of such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>gems: but are they to cover their feet<a id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> as well with gold, and
so, between the stola<a id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">786</a> of the matrons and the garb of the
plebeians, establish an intermediate<a id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">787</a> or equestrian<a id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">788</a> order of
females? Much more becomingly do we accord this distinction
to our pages,<a id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">789</a> and the adorned beauty of these youths has
quite changed the features of our public baths.</p>

<p>At the present day, too, a fashion has been introduced
among the men even, of wearing effigies upon their fingers
representing Harpocrates<a id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> and other divinities of Egypt. In
the reign of Claudius, also, there was introduced another
unusual distinction, in the case of those to whom was granted
the right of free admission,<a id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">791</a> that, namely, of wearing the
likeness of the emperor engraved in gold upon a ring: a
circumstance that gave rise to vast numbers of informations,
until the timely elevation of the Emperor Vespasianus rendered
them impossible, by proclaiming that the right of admission to
the emperor belonged equally to all. Let these particulars
suffice on the subject of golden rings and the use of them.</p>

<p>The next<a id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> crime committed against the welfare of mankind
was on the part of him who was the first to coin a denarius<a id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">793</a>
of gold, a crime the author of which is equally unknown.
The Roman people made no use of impressed silver even before
the period of the defeat<a id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">794</a> of King Pyrrhus. The ‚Äúas‚Äù of copper
weighed exactly one libra; and hence it is that we still use
the terms ‚Äúlibella‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">795</a> and ‚Äúdupondius.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">796</a> Hence it is, too, that

nothing more than ‚Äústipis pondera;<a id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> and from the same source
those other words, ‚Äúdispensatores‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> and ‚Äúlibripendes.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> It is
also from this circumstance that in sales of slaves, at the present
day even, the formality of using the balance is introduced.</p>

<p>King Servius was the first to make an impress upon copper.
Before his time, according to Tim√¶us, at Rome the raw metal
only was used. The form of a sheep was the first figure impressed
upon money, and to this fact it owes its name,
‚Äúpecunia.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">804</a> The highest figure at which one man‚Äôs property
was assessed in the reign of that king was one hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>twenty thousand asses, and consequently that amount of property
was considered the standard of the first class.</p>

<p>Silver was not impressed with a mark until the year of the
City 485, the year of the consulship of Q. Ogulnius and C.
Fabius, five years before the First Punic War; at which time
it was ordained that the value of the denarius should be ten
libr√¶<a id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">805</a> of copper, that of the quinarius five libr√¶, and that
of the sestertius two libr√¶ and a half. The weight, however,
of the libra of copper was diminished during the First
Punic War, the republic not having means to meet its expenditure:
in consequence of which, an ordinance was made
that the as should in future be struck of two ounces weight.
By this contrivance a saving of five-sixths was effected, and
the public debt was liquidated. The impression upon these
copper coins was a two-faced Janus on one side, and the beak
of a ship of war on the other: the triens,<a id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> however, and the
quadrans,<a id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> bore the impression of a ship. The quadrans, too,
had, previously to this, been called ‚Äúteruncius,‚Äù as being three
unci√¶<a id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">808</a> in weight. At a later period again, when Hannibal
was pressing hard upon Rome, in the dictatorship of Q. Fabius
Maximus, asses of one ounce weight were struck, and it was
ordained that the value of the denarius should be sixteen asses,
that of the quinarius eight asses, and that of the sestertius
four asses; by which last reduction of the weight of the as
the republic made a clear gain of one half. Still, however,
so far as the pay of the soldiers is concerned, one denarius has
always been given for every ten asses. The impressions upon
the coins of silver were two-horse and four-horse chariots,
and hence it is that they received the names of ‚Äúbigati‚Äù and
‚Äúquadrigati.‚Äù</p>

<p>Shortly after, in accordance with the Law of Papirius, asses
were coined weighing half an ounce only. Livius Drusus,
when<a id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> tribune of the people, alloyed the silver with one-eighth
part of copper. The coin that is known at the present day
as the ‚Äúvictoriatus,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">810</a> was first struck in accordance with the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>Clodian Law: before which period, a coin of this name was
imported from Illyricum, but was only looked upon as an article
of merchandize. The impression upon it is a figure of Victory,
and hence its name.</p>

<p>The first golden coin was struck sixty-two years after that
of silver, the scruple of gold being valued at twenty sesterces; a
computation which gave, according to the value of the sesterce
then in use, nine hundred sesterces to each libra of gold.<a id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">811</a>
In later times, again, an ordinance was made, that denarii of
gold should be struck, at the rate of forty denarii<a id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> to each
libra of gold; after which period, the emperors gradually
curtailed the weight of the golden denarius, until at last, in
the reign of Nero, it was coined at the rate of forty-five to
the libra.</p>

<p>But the invention of money opened a new field to human
avarice, by giving rise to usury and the practice of lending
money at interest, while the owner passes a life of idleness:
and it was with no slow advances that, not mere avarice only,
but a perfect hunger<a id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> for gold became inflamed with a sort of
rage for acquiring: to such a degree, in fact, that Septimuleius,
the familiar friend of Caius Gracchus, not only cut off his
head, upon which a price had been set of its weight in gold,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>but, before<a id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> bringing it to Opimius,<a id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">815</a> poured molten lead into
the mouth, and so not only was guilty of the crime of parricide,
but added to his criminality by cheating the state. Nor
was it now any individual citizen, but the universal Roman
name, that had been rendered infamous by avarice, when King
Mithridates caused molten gold to be poured into the mouth
of Aquilius<a id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">816</a> the Roman general, whom he had taken prisoner:
such were the results of cupidity.</p>

<p>One cannot but feel ashamed, on looking at those new-fangled
names which are invented every now and then, from the
Greek language, by which to designate vessels of silver filagreed<a id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">817</a>
or inlaid with gold, and the various other practices by
which such articles of luxury, when only gilded,<a id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">818</a> are made to
sell at a higher price than they would have done if made of
solid gold: and this, too, when we know that Spartacus<a id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">819</a> forbade
any one of his followers to introduce either gold or silver into
the camp‚Äîso much more nobleness of mind was there in those
days, even in our runaway slaves.</p>

<p>The orator Messala has informed us that Antonius the triumvir
made use of golden vessels when satisfying the most humiliating
wants of nature, a piece of criminality that would have
reflected disgrace upon Cleopatra even! Till then, the most
consummate instances of a similar licentiousness had been found
among strangers only‚Äîthat of King Philip, namely, who was in
the habit of sleeping with a golden goblet placed beneath his pillows,
and that of Hagnon of Teos, a commander under Alexander
the Great, who used to fasten the soles of his sandals
with nails of gold.<a id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">820</a> It was reserved for Antonius to be the
only one thus to impart a certain utility to gold, by putting an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>insult upon Nature. Oh how righteously would he himself
have been proscribed! but then the proscription should have
been made by Spartacus.<a id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">821</a></p>

CHAP. 15.‚ÄîTHE PERSONS WHO HAVE POSSESSED THE GREATEST
QUANTITY OF GOLD AND SILVER.</span></h3></div>

<p>For my own part, I am much surprised that the Roman people
has always imposed upon conquered nations a tribute in
silver, and not in gold; Carthage, for instance, from which,
upon its conquest under Hannibal, a ransom was exacted in
the shape of a yearly<a id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">822</a> payment, for fifty years, of eight hundred
thousand pounds‚Äô weight of silver, but no gold. And yet
it does not appear that this could have arisen from there being
so little gold then in use throughout the world. Midas and
Cr≈ìsus, before this, had possessed gold to an endless amount:
Cyrus, already, on his conquest of Asia,<a id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> had found a booty
consisting of twenty-four thousand pounds‚Äô weight of gold,
in addition to vessels and other articles of wrought gold, as
well as leaves<a id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">824</a> of trees, a plane-tree, and a vine, all made of
that metal.</p>

<p>It was through this conquest too, that he carried off five
hundred thousand<a id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> talents of silver, as well as the vase of
Semiramis,<a id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> the weight of which alone amounted to fifteen
talents, the Egyptian talent being equal, according to Varro,
to eighty of our pounds. Before this time too, Saulaces, the
descendant of √Ü√´tes, had reigned in Colchis,<a id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> who, on finding
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>a tract of virgin earth, in the country of the Suani,<a id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">828</a> extracted
from it a large amount of gold and silver, it is said, and whose
kingdom besides, had been famed for the possession of the
Golden Fleece. The golden arches, too, of his palace, we find
spoken of, the silver supports and columns, and pilasters, all
of which he had come into possession of on the conquest of
Sesostris,<a id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> king of Egypt; a monarch so haughty, that every
year, it is said, it was his practice to select one of his vassal
kings by lot, and yoking him to his car, celebrate his triumph
afresh.</p>

<p>We, too, have done things that posterity may probably look
upon as fabulous. C√¶sar, who was afterwards dictator, but
at that time √¶dile, was the first person, on the occasion of the
funeral games in honour of his father, to employ all the apparatus
of the arena<a id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> in silver; and it was on the same occasion
that for the first time criminals encountered wild beasts
with implements of silver, a practice imitated at the present
day in our municipal towns even.</p>

<p>At the games celebrated by C. Antonius the stage was made
of<a id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">831</a> silver; and the same was the case at those celebrated
by L. Mur√¶na. The Emperor Caius had a scaffold<a id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> introduced
into the Circus, upon which there were one hundred and
twenty-four thousand pounds‚Äô weight of silver. His successor
Claudius, on the occasion of his triumph over Britain, announced
by the inscriptions that among the coronets of gold,
there was one weighing seven thousand<a id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">833</a> pounds‚Äô weight, contributed

<p>In the consulship of Sextus Julius and Lucius Aurelius,<a id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">837</a>
seven years before the commencement of the Third Punic War,
there was in the treasury of the Roman people seventeen thousand
four hundred and ten pounds‚Äô weight of uncoined gold,
twenty-two thousand and seventy pounds‚Äô weight of silver, and
in specie, six million one hundred and thirty-five thousand
four hundred sesterces.</p>

<p>In the consulship of Sextus Julius and Lucius Marcius,
that is to say, at the commencement of the Social War,<a id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">838</a> there
was in the public treasury one million<a id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> six hundred and twenty
thousand eight hundred and thirty-one pounds‚Äô weight of gold.
Caius C√¶sar, at his first entry into Rome, during the civil
war which bears his name, withdrew from the treasury fifteen
thousand pounds‚Äô weight in gold ingots, thirty thousand pounds‚Äô
weight in uncoined silver, and in specie, three hundred thousand
sesterces: indeed, at no<a id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">840</a> period was the republic more
wealthy. √Ümilius Paulus, too, after the defeat of King Perseus,
paid into the public treasury, from the spoil obtained in
Macedonia, three hundred millions<a id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> of sesterces, and from this

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_19"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 19.‚ÄîFOR WHAT REASONS THE HIGHEST VALUE IS SET
UPON GOLD.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have already stated, in the Seventh<a id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">844</a> Book, who were the
first discoverers of gold, as well as nearly all the other metals.
The highest rank has been accorded to this substance, not, in
my opinion, for its colour, (which in silver is clearer<a id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> and more
like the light of day, for which reason silver is preferred for
our military ensigns, its brightness being seen at a greater distance);
and those persons are manifestly in error who think
that it is the resemblance of its colour to the stars<a id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> that is
so prized in gold, seeing that the various gems<a id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">847</a> and other
things of the same tint, are in no such particular request.
Nor yet is it for its weight or malleability<a id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">848</a> that gold has been
preferred to other metals, it being inferior in both these respects
to lead‚Äîbut it is because gold is the only<a id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">849</a> substance in
nature that suffers<a id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> no loss from the action of fire, and passes
unscathed through conflagrations and the flames of the funeral
pile. Nay, even more than this, the oftener gold is subjected
to the action of fire, the more refined in quality it becomes;
indeed, fire is one test of its goodness, as, when submitted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>to intense heat, gold ought to assume a similar colour,
and turn red and igneous in appearance; a mode of testing
which is known as ‚Äúobrussa.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">851</a></p>

<p>The first great proof, however, of the goodness of gold, is
its melting with the greatest difficulty; in addition to which,
it is a fact truly marvellous, that though proof against the most
intense fire, if made with wood charcoal, it will melt with the
greatest readiness upon a fire made with chaff;<a id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> and that, for
the purpose of purifying it, it is fused with lead.<a id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> There is
another reason too, which still more tends to enhance its value,
the fact that it wears the least of all metals by continual use:
whereas with silver, copper, and lead, lines may be traced,<a id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">854</a> and
the hands become soiled with the substance that comes from off
them. Nor is there any material more malleable than this,
none that admits of a more extended division, seeing that a
single ounce of it admits of being beaten out into seven hundred
and fifty<a id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">855</a> leaves, or more, four fingers in length by the
same in breadth. The thickest kind of gold-leaf is known as
‚Äúleaf of Pr√¶neste,‚Äù it still retaining that name from the
excellence of the gilding upon the statue of Fortune<a id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> there.
The next in thickness is known as the ‚Äúqu√¶storian leaf.‚Äù In
Spain, small pieces of gold are known by the name of ‚Äústriges.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">857</a></p>

<p>A thing that is not the case with any other metal, gold is
found pure in masses<a id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> or in the form of dust;<a id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> and whereas
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>all other metals, when found in the ore, require to be brought
to perfection by the aid of fire, this gold that I am speaking of
is gold the moment it is found, and has all its component parts
already in a state of perfection. This, however, is only such
gold as is found in the native state, the other kinds that we
shall have to speak of, being refined by art. And then, more
than anything else, gold is subject to no rust, no verdigris,<a id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">860</a>
no emanation whatever from it, either to alter its quality or
to lessen its weight. In addition to this, gold steadily resists
the corrosive action of salt and vinegar,<a id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> things which obtain
the mastery over all other substances: it admits, too, beyond
all other metals, of being spun out and woven<a id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">862</a> like wool.<a id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> Verrius
tells us that Tarquinius Priscus celebrated a triumph, clad
in a tunic of gold; and I myself have seen Agrippina, the wife
of the Emperor Claudius, on the occasion of a naval combat
which he exhibited, seated by him, attired in a military scarf<a id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">864</a>
made entirely of woven gold without any other material. For
this long time past, gold has been interwoven in the Attalic<a id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">865</a>
textures, an invention of the kings of Asia.</p>

CHAP. 20.‚ÄîTHE METHOD OF GILDING.</span></h3></div>

<p>On marble and other substances which do not admit of being
brought to a white heat, gilt is laid with glair of egg, and on
wood by the aid of a glutinous composition,<a id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">866</a> known as ‚Äúleucophoron:‚Äù
what this last is, and how it is prepared, we shall
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>state on the appropriate occasion.<a id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> The most convenient method
for gilding copper would be to employ quicksilver, or, at
all events, hydrargyros;<a id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">868</a>  but with reference to these substances,
as we shall have occasion to say when describing the nature<a id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> of
them, methods of adulteration have been devised. To effect this
mode of gilding, the copper is first well hammered, after which
it is subjected to the action of fire, and then cooled with a
mixture of salt, vinegar, and alum.<a id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">870</a> It is then cleansed of all
extraneous substances, it being known by its brightness when
it has been sufficiently purified. This done, it is again
heated by fire, in order to enable it, when thus prepared, with
the aid of an amalgam of pumice, alum, and quicksilver, to
receive the gold leaf when applied. Alum has the same property
of purifying copper, that we have already<a id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> mentioned
us belonging to lead with reference to gold.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_21"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 21. (4.)‚ÄîHOW GOLD IS FOUND.</span></h3></div>

<p>Gold is found in our own part of the world; not to mention
the gold extracted from the earth in India by the ants,<a id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">872</a> and
in Scythia by the Griffins.<a id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">873</a> Among us it is procured in
three different ways; the first of which is, in the shape of
dust, found in running streams, the Tagus<a id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">874</a> in Spain, for instance,
the Padus in Italy, the Hebrus in Thracia, the Pactolus in
Asia, and the Ganges in India; indeed, there is no gold found
in a more perfect state than this, thoroughly polished as it is
by the continual attrition of the current.</p>

<p>A second mode of obtaining gold is by sinking shafts or seeking
it among the debris of mountains; both of which methods
it will be as well to describe. The persons in search of gold
in the first place remove the ‚Äúsegutilum,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> such being the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>name of the earth which gives indication of the presence of
gold. This done, a bed is made, the sand of which is washed,
and, according to the residue found after washing, a conjecture
is formed as to the richness of the vein. Sometimes, indeed,
gold is found at once in the surface earth, a success, however,
but rarely experienced. Recently, for instance, in the reign of
Nero, a vein was discovered in Dalmatia, which yielded daily
as much as fifty pounds‚Äô weight of gold. The gold that is
thus found in the surface crust is known as ‚Äútalutium,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">876</a> in
cases where there is auriferous earth beneath. The mountains
of Spain,<a id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> in other respects arid and sterile, and productive of
nothing whatever, are thus constrained by man to be fertile,
in supplying him with this precious commodity.</p>

<p>The gold that is extracted from shafts is known by some
persons as ‚Äúcanalicium,‚Äù and by others as ‚Äúcanaliense;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">878</a> it
is found adhering to the gritty crust of marble,<a id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> and, altogether
different from the form in which it sparkles in the sapphirus<a id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">880</a>
of the East, and in the stone of Thebais<a id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> and other gems, it
is seen interlaced with the molecules of the marble. The
channels of these veins are found running in various directions
along the sides of the shafts, and hence the name of the gold
they yield‚Äî‚Äúcanalicium.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> In these shafts, too, the superincumbent
earth is kept from falling in by means of wooden
pillars. The substance that is extracted is first broken up,
and then washed; after which it is subjected to the action of
fire, and ground to a fine powder. This powder is known as
‚Äúapitascudes,‚Äù while the silver which becomes disengaged in
the furnace<a id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> has the name of ‚Äúsudor‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">884</a> given to it. The impurities
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>that escape by the chimney, as in the case of all
other metals, are known by the name of ‚Äúscoria.‚Äù In the
case of gold, this scoria is broken up a second time, and melted
over again. The crucibles used for this purpose are made of
‚Äútasconium,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">885</a> a white earth similar to potter‚Äôs clay in appearance;
there being no other substance capable of withstanding
the strong current of air, the action of the fire, and
the intense heat of the melted metal.</p>

<p>The third method of obtaining gold surpasses the labours
of the Giants<a id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">886</a> even: by the aid of galleries driven to a long
distance, mountains are excavated by the light of torches, the
duration of which forms the set times for work, the workmen
never seeing the light of day for many months together.
These mines are known as ‚Äúarrugi√¶;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> and not unfrequently
clefts are formed on a sudden, the earth sinks in, and the workmen
are crushed beneath; so that it would really appear less rash
to go in search of pearls and purples at the bottom of the sea,
so much more dangerous to ourselves have we made the earth
than the water! Hence it is, that in this kind of mining,
arches are left at frequent intervals for the purpose of supporting
the weight of the mountain above. In mining either
by shaft or by gallery, barriers of silex are met with, which
have to be driven asunder by the aid of fire and vinegar;<a id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">888</a> or
more frequently, as this method fills the galleries with suffocating
vapours and smoke, to be broken to pieces with bruising-machines
shod with pieces of iron weighing one hundred and
fifty pounds: which done, the fragments are carried out on the
workmen‚Äôs shoulders, night and day, each man passing them
on to his neighbour in the dark, it being only those at the pit‚Äôs
mouth that ever see the light. In cases where the bed of silex
appears too thick to admit of being penetrated, the miner traces
along the sides of it, and so turns it. And yet, after all, the labour
entailed by this silex is looked upon as comparatively easy, there
being an earth‚Äîa kind of potter‚Äôs clay mixed with gravel,
‚Äúgangadia‚Äù by name, which it is almost impossible to overcome.
This earth has to be attacked with iron wedges and hammers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>like those previously mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">889</a> and it is generally considered
that there is nothing more stubborn in existence‚Äîexcept indeed
the greed for gold, which is the most stubborn of all things.</p>

<p>When these operations are all completed, beginning at the
last, they cut away<a id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">890</a> the wooden pillars at the point where
they support the roof: the coming downfall gives warning,
which is instantly perceived by the sentinel, and by him only,
who is set to watch upon a peak of the same mountain. By
voice as well as by signals, he orders the workmen to be immediately
summoned from their labours, and at the same
moment takes to flight himself. The mountain, rent to pieces,
is cleft asunder, hurling its debris to a distance with a crash
which it is impossible for the human imagination to conceive;
and from the midst of a cloud of dust, of a density quite incredible,
the victorious miners gaze upon this downfall of
Nature. Nor yet even then are they sure of gold, nor indeed
were they by any means certain that there was any to be
found when they first began to excavate, it being quite sufficient,
as an inducement to undergo such perils and to incur
such vast expense, to entertain the hope that they shall obtain
what they so eagerly desire.</p>

<p>Another labour, too, quite equal to this, and one which entails
even greater expense, is that of bringing rivers<a id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">891</a> from
the more elevated mountain heights, a distance in many instances
of one hundred miles perhaps, for the purpose of
washing these debris. The channels thus formed are called
‚Äúcorrugi,‚Äù from our word ‚Äúcorrivatio,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">892</a> I suppose; and even
when these are once made, they entail a thousand fresh labours.
The fall, for instance, must be steep, that the water may be
precipitated, so to say, rather than flow; and it is in this
manner that it is brought from the most elevated points.
Then, too, vallies and crevasses have to be united by the aid of
aqueducts, and in another place impassable rocks have to be
hewn away, and forced to make room for hollowed troughs of
wood; the person hewing them hanging suspended all the
time with ropes, so that to a spectator who views the operations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>from a distance, the workmen have all the appearance, not so
much of wild beasts, as of birds upon the wing.<a id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> Hanging
thus suspended in most instances, they take the levels, and
trace with lines the course the water is to take; and thus,
where there is no room even for man to plant a footstep, are
rivers traced out by the hand of man. The water, too, is considered
in an unfit state for washing, if the current of the
river carries any mud along with it. The kind of earth that
yields this mud is known as ‚Äúurium;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">894</a> and hence it is that
in tracing out these channels, they carry the water over beds
of silex or pebbles, and carefully avoid this urium. When
they have reached the head of the fall, at the very brow of the
mountain, reservoirs are hollowed out, a couple of hundred
feet in length and breadth, and some ten feet in depth. In
these reservoirs there are generally five sluices left, about
three feet square; so that, the moment the reservoir is filled, the
floodgates are struck away, and the torrent bursts forth with
such a degree of violence as to roll onwards any fragments of
rock which may obstruct its passage.</p>

<p>When they have reached the level ground, too, there is
still another labour that awaits them. Trenches‚Äîknown as
‚Äúagog√¶‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">895</a>‚Äîhave to be dug for the passage of the water; and
these, at regular intervals, have a layer of ulex placed at the
bottom. This ulex<a id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">896</a> is a plant like rosemary in appearance,
rough and prickly, and well-adapted for arresting any pieces
of gold that may be carried along. The sides, too, are closed
in with planks, and are supported by arches when carried over
steep and precipitous spots. The earth, carried onwards in
the stream, arrives at the sea at last, and thus is the shattered
mountain washed away; causes which have greatly tended to
extend the shores of Spain by these encroachments upon the
deep. It is also by the agency of canals of this description
that the material, excavated at the cost of such immense labour
by the process previously described,<a id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">897</a> is washed and carried
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>away; for otherwise the shafts would soon be choked up
by it.</p>

<p>The gold found by excavating with galleries does not require
to be melted, but is pure gold at once. In these excavations,
too, it is found in lumps, as also in the shafts which are sunk,
sometimes exceeding ten pounds even. The names given to
these lumps are ‚Äúpalag√¶,‚Äù and ‚Äúpalacurn√¶,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> while the gold
found in small grains is known as ‚Äúbaluce.‚Äù The ulex that
is used for the above purpose is dried and burnt, after which
the ashes of it are washed upon a bed of grassy turf, in order
that the gold may be deposited thereupon.</p>

<p>Asturia, Gall√¶cia, and Lusitania furnish in this manner,
yearly, according to some authorities, twenty thousand pounds‚Äô
weight of gold, the produce of Asturia forming the major part.
Indeed, there is no part of the world that for centuries has
maintained such a continuous fertility in gold. I have already<a id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">899</a>
mentioned that by an ancient decree of the senate, the soil of
Italy has been protected from these researches; otherwise,
there would be no land more fertile in metals. There is extant
also a censorial law relative to the gold mines of Victumul√¶,
in the territory of Vercell√¶,<a id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">900</a> by which the farmers of the
revenue were forbidden to employ more than five thousand
men at the works.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_22"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 22.‚ÄîORPIMENT.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is also one other method of procuring gold; by making
it from orpiment,<a id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">901</a> a mineral dug from the surface of the earth
in Syria, and much used by painters. It is just the colour of
gold, but brittle, like mirror-stone,<a id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">902</a> in fact. This substance
greatly excited the hopes of the Emperor Caius,<a id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">903</a> a prince who
was most greedy for gold. He accordingly had a large quantity
of it melted, and really did obtain some excellent gold;<a id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">904</a> but
then the proportion was so extremely small, that he found himself
a loser thereby. Such was the result of an experiment
prompted solely by avarice: and this too, although the price
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>the orpiment itself was no more than four denarii per pound.
Since his time, the experiment has never been repeated.</p>

CHAP. 23.‚ÄîELECTRUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>In all<a id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> gold ore there is some silver, in varying proportions;
a tenth part in some instances, an eighth in others. In one
mine, and that only, the one known as the mine of Albucrara,
in Gall√¶cia,<a id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">906</a> the proportion of silver is but one thirty-sixth:
hence it is that the ore of this mine is so much more valuable
than that of others. Whenever the proportion of silver is one-fifth,
the ore is known also by the name of ‚Äúelectrum;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">907</a> grains,
too, of this metal are often found in the gold known as ‚Äúcanaliense.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">908</a>
An artificial<a id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> electrum, too, is made, by mixing
silver with gold. If the proportion of silver exceeds one-fifth,
the metal offers no resistance on the anvil.</p>

<p>Electrum, too, was highly esteemed in ancient times, as we
learn from the testimony of Homer, who represents<a id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> the palace
of Menela√ºs as refulgent with gold and electrum, silver and
ivory. At Lindos, in the island of Rhodes, there is a temple
dedicated to Minerva, in which there is a goblet of electrum,
consecrated by Helena: history states also that it was moulded
after the proportions of her bosom. One peculiar advantage
of electrum is, its superior brilliancy to silver by lamp-light.
Native electrum has also the property of detecting poisons;
for in such case, semicircles, resembling the rainbow in appearance,
will form upon the surface of the goblet, and emit a
crackling noise, like that of flame, thus giving a twofold indication
of the presence of poison.<a id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">911</a></p>

<p>The first statue of massive gold, without any hollowness
within, and anterior to any of those statues of bronze even,
which are known as ‚Äúholosphyrat√¶,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">912</a> is said to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>erected in the Temple of the goddess Ana√Øtis. To what particular
region this name belongs, we have already<a id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">913</a> stated, it
being that of a divinity<a id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> held in the highest veneration by
the nations in that part of the world. This statue was carried
off during the wars of Antonius with the people of Parthia;
and a witty saying is told, with reference to it, of one of the
veterans of the Roman army, a native of Bononia. Entertaining
on one occasion the late Emperor Augustus at dinner,
he was asked by that prince whether he was aware that the
person who was the first to commit this violence upon the
statue, had been struck with blindness and paralysis, and then
expired. To this he made answer, that at that very moment
Augustus was making his dinner off of one of her legs, for that
he himself was the very man, and to that bit of plunder he
had been indebted for all his fortune.<a id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">915</a></p>

<p>As regards statues of human beings, Gorgias of Leontini<a id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">916</a>
was the first to erect a solid statue of gold, in the Temple at
Delphi, in honour of himself, about the seventieth<a id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">917</a> Olympiad:

CHAP. 25.‚ÄîEIGHT REMEDIES DERIVED FROM GOLD.</span></h3></div>

<p>Gold is efficacious as a remedy in many ways, being applied
to wounded persons and to infants, to render any malpractices
of sorcery comparatively innocuous that may be directed against
them. Gold, however, itself is mischievous in its effects if
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>carried over the head, in the case of chickens and lambs more
particularly. The proper remedy in such case is to wash the
gold, and to sprinkle the water upon the objects which it is
wished to preserve. Gold, too, is melted with twice its weight
of salt, and three times its weight of misy;<a id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">918</a> after which it is
again melted with two parts of salt and one of the stone called
‚Äúschistos.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">919</a> Employed in this manner, it withdraws the
natural acridity from the substances torrefied with it in the
crucible, while at the same time it remains pure and incorrupt;
the residue forming an ash which is preserved in an earthen
vessel, and is applied with water for the cure of lichens on the
face: the best method of washing it off is with bean-meal.
These ashes have the property also of curing fistulas and the
discharges known as ‚Äúh√¶morrhoides:‚Äù with the addition, too, of
powdered pumice, they are a cure for putrid ulcers and sores
which emit an offensive smell.</p>

<p>Gold, boiled in honey with melanthium<a id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">920</a> and applied as a
liniment to the navel, acts as a gentle purgative upon the
bowels. M. Varro assures us that gold is a cure for warts.<a id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">921</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_26"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 26. (5.)‚ÄîCHRYSOCOLLA.</span></h3></div>

<p>Chrysocolla<a id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">922</a> is a liquid which is found in the shafts already
mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> flowing through the veins of gold; a kind of
slime which becomes indurated by the cold of winter till it
has attained the hardness even of pumice. The most esteemed
kind of it, it has been ascertained, is found in copper-mines,
the next best being the produce of silver-mines: it is found
also in lead-mines, but that found in combination with gold
ore is much inferior.</p>

<p>In all these mines, too, an artificial chrysocolla is manufactured;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>much inferior, however, to the native chrysocolla.
The method of preparing it consists in introducing water
gradually into a vein of metal, throughout the winter and until
the month of June; after which, it is left to dry up during
the months of June and July: so that, in fact, it is quite evident
that chrysocolla is nothing else but the putrefaction of a metallic
vein. Native chrysocolla, known as ‚Äúuva,‚Äù differs from
the other in its hardness more particularly; and yet, hard as
it is, it admits of being coloured with the plant known as
‚Äúlutum.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> Like flax and wool, it is of a nature which imbibes
liquids. For the purpose of dyeing it, it is first bruised in a
mortar, after which, it is passed through a fine sieve. This
done, it is ground, and then passed through a still finer sieve;
all that refuses to pass being replaced in the mortar, and subjected
once more to the mill. The finest part of the powder is
from time to time measured out into a crucible, where it is
macerated in vinegar, so that all the hard particles may be
dissolved; after which, it is pounded again, and then rinsed
in shell-shaped vessels, and left to dry. This done, the chrysocolla
is dyed by the agency of schist alum<a id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">925</a> and the plant
above-mentioned; and thus is it painted itself before it serves
to paint. It is of considerable importance, too, that it should
be absorbent and readily take the dye: indeed, if it does not
speedily take the colour, scytanum and turbistum<a id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">926</a> are added to
the dye; such being the name of two drugs which compel it to
absorb the colouring matter.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_27"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 27.‚ÄîTHE USE MADE OF CHRYSOCOLLA IN PAINTING.</span></h3></div>

<p>When chrysocolla has been thus dyed, painters call it ‚Äúorobitis,‚Äù
and distinguish two kinds of it, the cleansed<a id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> orobitis,<a id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">928</a>
which is kept for making lomentum,<a id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">929</a> and the liquid, the balls
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>being dissolved for use by evaporation.<a id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">930</a> Both these kinds
are prepared in Cyprus,<a id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">931</a> but the most esteemed is that made
in Armenia, the next best being that of Macedonia: it is Spain,
however, that produces the most. The great point of its excellence
consists in its producing exactly the tint of corn when
in a state of the freshest verdure.<a id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">932</a> Before now, we have seen,
at the spectacles exhibited by the Emperor Nero, the arena of
the Circus entirely sanded with chrysocolla, when the prince
himself, clad in a dress of the same colour, was about to exhibit
as a charioteer.<a id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">933</a></p>

<p>The unlearned multitude of artisans distinguish three
kinds of chrysocolla; the rough chrysocolla, which is valued
at seven denarii per pound; the middling, worth five denarii;
and the bruised, also known as the ‚Äúherbaceous‚Äù chrysocolla,
worth three denarii per pound. Before laying on the
sanded<a id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">934</a> chrysocolla, they underlay coats of atramentum<a id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">935</a>
and par√¶tonium,<a id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">936</a> substances which make it hold, and impart
a softness to the colours. The par√¶tonium, as it is
naturally very unctuous, and, from its smoothness, extremely
tenacious, is laid on first, and is then covered with a coat of
atramentum, lest the par√¶tonium, from its extreme whiteness,
should impart a paleness to the chrysocolla. The kind known
as ‚Äúlutea,‚Äù derives its name, it is thought, from the plant
called ‚Äúlutum;‚Äù which itself is often pounded with c√¶ruleum<a id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">937</a>
instead of real chrysocolla, and used for painting,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>making a very inferior kind of green and extremely deceptive.<a id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">938</a></p>

<p>Chroysocolla, too, is made use of in medicine. In combination
with wax and oil, it is used as a detergent for wounds;
and used by itself in the form of a powder, it acts as a desiccative,
and heals them. In cases, too, of quinsy and hardness
of breathing, chrysocolla is prescribed, in the form of an electuary,
with honey. It acts as an emetic also, and is used as an
ingredient in eye-salves, for the purpose of effacing cicatrizations
upon the eyes. In green plasters too, it is used, for
soothing pain and making scars disappear. This kind of
chrysocolla<a id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">939</a> is known by medical men as ‚Äúacesis,‚Äù and is altogether
different from orobitis.</p>

CHAP. 29.‚ÄîTHE CHRYSOCOLLA OF THE GOLDSMITHS, KNOWN ALSO

<p>The goldsmiths also employ a chrysocolla<a id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">940</a> of their own, for
the purpose of soldering gold; and it is from this chrysocolla,
they say, that all the other substances, which present a similar
green, have received their name. This preparation is made
from verdigris of Cyprian copper, the urine of a youth who
has not arrived at puberty, and a portion of nitre.<a id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">941</a> It is then
pounded with a pestle of Cyprian copper, in a copper mortar,
and the name given to the mixture is ‚Äúsanterna.‚Äù It is in this
way that the gold known as ‚Äúsilvery‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> gold is soldered; one
sign of its being so alloyed being its additional brilliancy on
the application of santerna. If, on the other hand, the gold
is impregnated with copper, it will contract, on coming in
contact with the santerna, become dull, and only be soldered
with the greatest difficulty: indeed, for this last kind of gold,
there is a peculiar solder employed, made of gold and one-seventh
part of silver, in addition to the materials above-mentioned,
the whole beaten up together.</p>

METALLIC SUBSTANCES, AND BRINGING THEM TO A STATE OF

<p>While speaking on this subject, it will be as well to annex
the remaining particulars, that our admiration may here be
drawn to all the marvels presented by Nature in connection
therewith. The proper solder for gold is that above described;
for iron, potter‚Äôs clay; for copper, when in masses, cadmia,<a id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">943</a>
and in sheets, alum; for lead and marble, resin. Lead is also
united by the aid of white lead;<a id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">944</a> white lead with white lead,
by the agency of oil; stannum, with copper file-dust; and
silver, with stannum.<a id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">945</a></p>

<p>For smelting copper and iron, pine-wood is the best, Egyptian
papyrus being also very good for the purpose. Gold is
melted most easily with a fire made of chaff.<a id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">946</a> Limestone
and Thracian stone<a id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">947</a> are ignited by the agency of water, this
last being extinguished by the application of oil. Fire, however,
is extinguished most readily by the application of vinegar,
viscus,<a id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">948</a> and unboiled eggs. Earth will under no circumstance
ignite. When charcoal has been once quenched, and then again

<p>After stating these facts, we come to speak of silver ore,
the next<a id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">949</a> folly of mankind. Silver is never found but in
shafts sunk deep in the ground, there being no indications to
raise hopes of its existence, no shining sparkles, as in the case
of gold. The earth in which it is found is sometimes red, sometimes
of an ashy hue. It is impossible, too, to melt<a id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">950</a> it, except
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>in combination with lead<a id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">951</a> or with galena,<a id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">952</a> this last being the
name given to the vein of lead that is mostly found running
near the veins of the silver ore. When submitted, too, to the
action of fire, part of the ore precipitates itself in the form of
lead,<a id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">953</a> while the silver is left floating on the surface,<a id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">954</a> like oil
on water.</p>

<p>Silver is found in nearly all our provinces, but the finest of
all is that of Spain; where it is found, like gold, in uncultivated
soils, and in the mountains even. Wherever, too, one
vein of silver has been met with, another is sure to be found
not far off: a thing that has been remarked, in fact, in the case
of nearly all the metals, which would appear from this circumstance
to have derived their Greek name of ‚Äúmetalla.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">955</a> It
is a remarkable fact, that the shafts opened by Hannibal<a id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">956</a> in
the Spanish provinces are still worked, their names being derived
from the persons who were the first to discover them.
One of these mines, which at the present day is still called B√¶belo,
furnished Hannibal with three hundred pounds‚Äô weight of silver
per day. The mountain is already excavated for a distance of
fifteen hundred<a id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">957</a> paces; and throughout the whole of this
distance there are water-bearers<a id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">958</a> standing night and day,
baling out the water in turns, regulated by the light of torches,
and so forming quite a river.</p>

<p>The vein of silver that is found nearest the surface is known
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>by the name of ‚Äúcrudaria.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> In ancient times, the excavations
used to be abandoned the moment alum<a id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">960</a> was met with, and no
further<a id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">961</a> search was made. Of late, however, the discovery of
a vein of copper beneath alum, has withdrawn any such limits
to man‚Äôs hopes. The exhalations from silver-mines are dangerous
to all animals, but to dogs more particularly. The
softer they are, the more beautiful gold and silver are considered.
It is a matter of surprise with most persons, that lines
traced<a id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">962</a> with silver should be black.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_32"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 32.‚ÄîQUICKSILVER.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is a mineral also found in these veins of silver, which
yields a humour that is always<a id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">963</a> liquid, and is known as
‚Äúquicksilver.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">964</a> It acts as a poison<a id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">965</a> upon everything, and
pierces vessels even, making its way through them by the
agency of its malignant properties.<a id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> All substances float upon
the surface of quicksilver, with the exception of gold,<a id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> this
being the only substance that it attracts to itself.<a id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> Hence
it is, that it is such an excellent refiner of gold; for, on being
briskly shaken in an earthen vessel with gold, it rejects all
the impurities that are mixed with it. When once it has thus
expelled these superfluities, there is nothing to do but to separate
it from the gold; to effect which, it is poured out upon
skins that have been well tawed, and so, exuding through them
like a sort of perspiration, it leaves the gold in a state of
purity behind.<a id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">969</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>Hence it is, too, that when copper has to be gilded,<a id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">970</a> a coat of
quicksilver is laid beneath the gold leaf, which it retains in its
place with the greatest tenacity: in cases, however, where the
leaf is single, or very thin, the presence of the quicksilver is
detected by the paleness of the colour.<a id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">971</a> For this reason, persons,
when meditating a piece of fraud, have been in the habit
of substituting glair of egg for quicksilver, and then laying
upon it a coat of hydrargyros, a substance of which we shall
make further mention in the appropriate place.<a id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> Generally
speaking, quicksilver has not been found in any large quantities.</p>

CHAP. 33.‚ÄîSTIMMI, STIBI, ALABASTRUM, LARBASIS, OR PLATYOPHTHALMON.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the same mines in which silver is found, there is also
found a substance which, properly speaking, may be called a
stone made of concrete froth.<a id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">973</a> It is white and shining, without
being transparent, and has the several names of stimmi,
stibi, alabastrum,<a id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> and larbasis. There are two kinds of it,
the male and the female.<a id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">975</a> The latter kind is the more approved
of, the male<a id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">976</a> stimmi being more uneven, rougher to
the touch, less ponderous, not so radiant, and more gritty.
The female kind, on the other hand, is bright and friable, and
separates in lamin√¶, and not in globules.<a id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">977</a></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_34"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 34.‚ÄîSEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED PROM STIMMI.</span></h3></div>

<p>Stimmi is possessed of certain astringent and refrigerative
properties, its principal use, in medicine, being for the eyes.
Hence it is that most persons call it ‚Äúplatyophthalmon,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">978</a> it being
extensively employed in the calliblepharic<a id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">979</a> preparations of
females, for the purpose of dilating the eyes. It acts also as a
check upon fluxes of the eyes and ulcerations of those organs;
being used, as a powder, with pounded frankincense and gum.
It has the property, too, of arresting discharges of blood from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>the brain; and, sprinkled in the form of a powder, it is extremely
efficacious for the cure of recent wounds and bites of dogs which
have been some time inflicted. For the cure of burns it is remarkably
good, mixed with grease, litharge,<a id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">980</a> ceruse, and wax.</p>

<p>The method of preparing it, is to burn it, enclosed in a
coat of cow-dung, in a furnace; which done, it is quenched
with woman‚Äôs milk, and pounded with rain-water in a mortar.<a id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">981</a>
While this is doing, the thick and turbid part is poured off
from time to time into a copper vessel, and purified with nitre.<a id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">982</a>
The lees of it, which are rejected, are recognized by their
being full of lead and falling to the bottom. The vessel into
which the turbid part has been poured off, is then covered
with a linen cloth and left untouched for a night; the portion
that lies upon the surface being poured off the following day,
or else removed with a sponge. The part that has fallen to
the bottom of the vessel is regarded as the choicest<a id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">983</a> part, and
is left, covered with a linen cloth, to dry in the sun, but not
to become parched. This done, it is again pounded in a
mortar, and then divided into tablets. But the main thing of
all is, to observe such a degree of nicety in heating it, as not
to let it become lead.<a id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">984</a> Some persons, when preparing it on
the fire, use grease<a id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">985</a> instead of dung. Others, again, bruise it
in water and then pass it through a triple strainer of linen
cloth; after which, they reject the lees, and pour off the
remainder of the liquid, collecting all that is deposited at the
bottom, and using it as an ingredient in plasters and eye-salves.</p>

CHAP. 35.‚ÄîTHE SCORIA OF SILVER. SIX REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>The scoria of silver is called by the Greeks ‚Äúhelcysma.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">986</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>It has certain restringent and refrigerative effects upon bodies,
and, like molybd√¶na, of which we shall make further mention
when speaking<a id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">987</a> of lead, is used as an ingredient in making
plasters, those more particularly which are to promote the
cicatrization of wounds. It is employed also for the cure of
tenesmus and dysentery, being injected in the form of a clyster
with myrtle-oil. It forms an ingredient, too, in the medicaments
known as ‚Äúlipar√¶,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">988</a> for the removal of fleshy excrescences
in sores, ulcerations arising from chafing, or running
ulcers on the head.</p>

<p>The same mines also furnish us with the preparation known
as ‚Äúscum of silver.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">989</a> There are three<a id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">990</a> varieties of it; the
best, known as ‚Äúchrysitis;‚Äù the second best, the name of
which is ‚Äúargyritis;‚Äù and a third kind, which is called
‚Äúmolybditis.‚Äù In most instances, too, all these tints are to
be found in the same cake.<a id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">991</a></p>

<p>The most approved kind is that of Attica; the next being
that which comes from Spain. Chrysitis is the produce of
the metallic vein,<a id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">992</a> argyritis is obtained from the silver itself,
and molybditis is the result of the smelting of lead,<a id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">993</a> a work
that is done at Puteoli; to which last circumstance, in fact, molybditis
owes its name.<a id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">994</a> All these substances are prepared in
the following manner: the metal is first melted, and then allowed
to flow from a more elevated receiver into a lower. From
this last it is lifted by the aid of iron spits, and is then twirled
round at the end of the spit in the midst of the flames, in
order to make it all the lighter. Thus, as may be easily perceived
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>from the name, it is in reality the scum of a substance
in a state of fusion‚Äîof the future metal, in fact. It differs
from scoria in the same way that the scum of a liquid differs
from the lees, the one<a id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">995</a> being an excretion thrown out by
the metal while purifying itself, the other<a id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">996</a> an excretion of
the metal when purified.</p>

<p>Some persons distinguish two kinds of scum of silver, and
give them the names of ‚Äúscirerytis‚Äù and ‚Äúpeumene;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> a third
variety being molybd√¶na, of which we shall have to make
further mention when treating of lead.<a id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">998</a> To make this scum
fit for use, the cakes are again broken into pieces the size
of a hazel-nut, and then melted, the fire being briskly blown
with the bellows. For the purpose of separating the charcoal
and ashes from it, it is then rinsed with vinegar or with wine,
and is so quenched. In the case of argyritis, it is recommended,
in order to blanch it, to break it into pieces the size
of a bean, and then to boil it with water in an earthen vessel,
first putting with it, wrapped in linen cloths, some new wheat
and barley, which are left there till they have lost the outer
coat. This done, they bruise the whole in mortars for six consecutive
days, taking care to rinse the mixture in cold water
three times a day, and after that, in an infusion of hot
water and fossil salt, one obolus of the latter to every pound
of scum: at the end of the six days it is put away for keeping
in a vessel of lead.</p>

<p>Some persons boil it with white beans and a ptisan<a id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">999</a> of
barley, and then dry it in the sun; others, again, with white
wool and beans, till such time as it imparts no darkness to the
wool; after which, first adding fossil<a id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a> salt, they change the
water from time to time, and then dry it during the forty hottest
days of summer. In some instances the practice is, to
boil it in water in a swine‚Äôs paunch, and then to take it out
and rub it with nitre; after which, following the preceding
method, they pound it in a mortar with salt. Some again
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>never boil it, but pound it only with salt, and then rinse it
with water.</p>

<p>Scum of silver is used as an ingredient in eye-salves, and,
in the form of a liniment, by females, for the purpose of removing
spots and blemishes caused by scars, as also in washes
for the hair. Its properties are desiccative, emollient, refrigerative,
temperative, and detergent. It fills up cavities in
the flesh produced by ulceration, and reduces tumours. For
all these purposes it is employed as an ingredient in plaster,
and in the lipar√¶ previously mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a> In combination
with rue, myrtle, and vinegar, it removes erysipelas: and,
with myrtle and wax, it is a cure for chilblains.</p>

CHAP. 36. (7.)‚ÄîMINIUM: FOR WHAT RELIGIOUS PURPOSES IT
WAS USED BY THE ANCIENTS.</span></h3></div>

<p>It is also in silver-mines that minium<a id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a> is found, a pigment
held at the present day in very high estimation; and by the
Romans in former times not only held in the highest estimation,
but used for sacred purposes as well. Verrius enumerates
certain authors, upon whose testimony we find it satisfactorily
established that it was the custom upon festivals to
colour the face of the statue of Jupiter even with minium, as
well as the bodies<a id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a> of triumphant generals; and that it was
in this guise that Camillus celebrated his triumph. We find,
too, that it is through the same religious motives that it is
employed at the present day for colouring the unguents used
at triumphal banquets, and that it is the first duty of the
censors to make a contract for painting the statue of Jupiter<a id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a>
with this colour.</p>

<p>For my own part, I am quite at a loss for the origin of this
usage; but it is a well-known fact, that at the present day
even, minium is in great esteem with the nations of √Üthiopia,
their nobles being in the habit of staining the body all over
with it, and this being the colour appropriated to the statues
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>of their gods. I shall therefore use all the more diligence in
enquiring into all the known facts respecting it.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_37"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 37.‚ÄîTHE DISCOVERY AND ORIGIN OF MINIUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>Theophrastus states that, ninety years before the magistracy
of Praxibulus at Athens‚Äîa date which answers to the
year of our City, 439‚Äîminium was discovered by Callias the
Athenian, who was in hopes to extract gold, by submitting to
the action of fire the red sand that was found in the silver-mines.
This, he says, was the first discovery of minium. He states,
also, that in his own time, it was already found in Spain, but
of a harsh and sandy nature; as also in Colchis, upon a certain
inaccessible rock there, from which it was brought down
by the agency of darts. This, however, he says, was only an
adulterated kind of minium, the best of all being that procured
in the Cilbian Plains,<a id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a> above Ephesus, the sand of which
has just the colour of the kermes berry.<a id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a> This sand, he informs
us, is first ground to powder and then washed, the
portion that settles at the bottom being subjected to a second
washing. From this circumstance, he says, arises a difference
in the article; some persons being in the habit of preparing
their minium with a single washing, while with others it is
more diluted. The best kind, however, he says, is that which
has undergone a second washing.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_38"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 38.‚ÄîCINNABARIS.</span></h3></div>

<p>I am not surprised that this colour should have been held
in such high esteem; for already, in the days of the Trojan
War, rubrica<a id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a> was highly valued, as appears from the testimony
of Homer, who particularly notices the ships that were
coloured with it, whereas, in reference to other colours and
paintings, he but rarely notices them. The Greeks call this
red earth ‚Äúmiltos,‚Äù and give to minium the name of ‚Äúcinnabaris,‚Äù
and hence the error<a id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a> caused by the two meanings of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>the same word; this being properly the name given to the
thick matter which issues from the dragon when crushed beneath
the weight of the dying elephant, mixed with the blood
of either animal, as already described.<a id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a> Indeed this last is the
only colour that in painting gives a proper representation of
blood. This cinnabaris, too, is extremely useful as an ingredient
in antidotes and various medicaments. But, by Hercules!
our physicians, because minium also has the name of
‚Äúcinnabaris,‚Äù use it as a substitute for the other, and so employ
a poison, as we shall shortly<a id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a> show it to be.</p>

<div class="section">

CHAP. 39.‚ÄîTHE EMPLOYMENT OF CINNABARIS IN PAINTING.</span></h3></div>

<p>The ancients used to paint with cinnabaris<a id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a> those pictures
of one colour, which are still known among us as ‚Äúmonochromata.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a>
They painted also with the minium of Ephesus:<a id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a>
but the use of this last has been abandoned, from the vast
trouble which the proper keeping of the picture entailed. And
then besides, both these colours were thought to be too harsh;
the consequence of which is, that painters have now adopted
the use of rubrica<a id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a> and of sinopis, substances of which I shall

IT IN PAINTING.</span></h3></div>

<p>According to Juba minium is also a production of Carmania,<a id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a>
and Timagenes says that it is found in √Üthiopia. But from
neither of those regions is it imported to Rome, nor, indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>from hardly any other quarter but Spain; that of most note
coming from Sisapo,<a id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a> a territory of B√¶tica, the mine of minium
there forming a part of the revenues of the Roman
people. Indeed there is nothing guarded with a more constant
circumspection; for it is not allowable to reduce and refine
the ore upon the spot, it being brought to Rome in a crude
state and under seal, to the amount of about two thousand
pounds per annum. At Rome, the process of washing is performed,
and, in the sale of it, the price is regulated by statute;
it not being allowed to exceed<a id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a> seventy sesterces per pound.
There are numerous ways, however, of adulterating it, a source
of considerable plunder to the company.<a id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a></p>

<p>For there is, in fact, another kind<a id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a> of minium, found in most
silver-mines as well as lead-mines, and prepared by the calcination
of certain stones that are found mixed with the metallic
vein‚Äînot the minerals, however, to the fluid humours of
which we have given<a id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a> the name of quicksilver; for if those are
subjected to the action of fire they will yield silver‚Äîbut another
kind of stone<a id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> that is found with them. These barren<a id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a> stones,
too, may be recognized by their uniform leaden colour, and it
is only when in the furnace that they turn red. After being
duly calcined they are pulverized, and thus form a minium of
second-rate quality, known to but very few, and far inferior
to the produce of the native sand that we have mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a>
It is with this substance, then, as also with syricum, that
the genuine minium is adulterated in the manufactories of the
company. How syricum is prepared we shall describe in the
appropriate place.<a id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a> One motive, however, for giving an under-coat
of syricum to minium, is the evident saving of expense
that results therefrom. Minium, too, in another way affords a
very convenient opportunity to painters for pilfering, by washing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>their brushes,<a id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a> filled with the colouring matter, every now
and then. The minium of course falls to the bottom, and is
thus so much gained by the thief.</p>

<p>Genuine minium ought to have the brilliant colour of the
kermes berry;<a id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a> but when that of inferior quality is used for
walls, the brightness of it is sure to be tarnished by the
moisture, and this too, although the substance itself is a sort
of metallic mildew. In the mines of Sisapo, the veins are
composed exclusively of the sandy particles of minium, without
the intermixture of any silver whatever; the practice being
to melt it like gold. Minium is assayed by the agency of gold
in a state of incandescence: if it has been adulterated, it will
turn black, but if genuine, it retains its colour. I find it
stated also that minium is adulterated with lime; the proper
mode of detecting which, is similarly to employ a sheet of red
hot iron, if there should happen to be no gold at hand.</p>

<p>To objects painted with minium the action of the sun and
moon is highly injurious. The proper method of avoiding
this inconvenience, is to dry the wall, and then to apply, with,
a hair brush, hot Punic wax, melted with oil; after which,
the varnish must be heated, with an application of gall-nuts,
burnt to a red heat, till it quite perspires. This done, it must
be smoothed down with rollers<a id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a> made of wax, and then polished
with clean linen cloths, like marble, when made to shine.
Persons employed in the manufactories in preparing minium
protect the face with masks of loose bladder-skin, in order to
avoid inhaling the dust, which is highly pernicious; the covering
being at the same time sufficiently transparent to admit of
being seen through.</p>

<p>Minium is employed also for writing<a id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a> in books; and the
letters made with it being more distinct, even on gold or marble,
it is used for the inscriptions upon tombs.</p>

<p>Human industry has also discovered a method of extracting
hydrargyros<a id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> from the inferior minium, a substitute for quicksilver,
the further mention of which was deferred, a few pages
before,<a id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a> to the present occasion. There are two methods of
preparing this substance; either by pounding minium and
vinegar with a brazen pestle and mortar, or else by putting
minium into flat earthen pans, covered with a lid, and then
enclosed in an iron seething-pot well luted with potter‚Äôs clay.
A fire is then lighted under the pans, and the flame kept continually
burning by the aid of the bellows; which done, the
steam is carefully removed, that is found adhering to the lid,
being like silver in colour, and similar to water in its fluidity.
This liquid, too, is easily made to separate in globules, which,
from their fluid nature, readily unite.<a id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a></p>

<p>As it is a fact generally admitted, that minium is a poison,<a id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a>
I look upon all the recipes given as highly dangerous which
recommend its employment for medicinal purposes; with the
exception, perhaps, of those cases in which it is applied to the
head or abdomen, for the purpose of arresting h√¶morrhage,
due care being taken that it is not allowed to penetrate to the
viscera, or to touch any sore. Beyond such cases as these, for
my own part, I should never recommend it to be used in
medicine.</p>

CHAP. 44.‚ÄîTHE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SILVER, AND THE MODES
OF TESTING IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are two kinds of silver. On placing a piece of it
upon an iron fire-shovel at a white heat, if the metal remains
perfectly white, it is of the best quality: if again it turns of a
reddish colour, it is inferior; but if it becomes black, it is
worthless. Fraud, however, has devised means of stultifying
this test even; for by keeping the shovel immersed in men‚Äôs
urine, the piece of silver absorbs it as it burns, and so displays
a fictitious whiteness. There is also a kind of test with
reference to polished silver: when the human breath comes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>in contact with it, it should immediately be covered with
steam,<a id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a> the cloudiness disappearing at once.</p>

CHAP. 45. (9.)‚ÄîMIRRORS.</span></h3></div>

<p>It is generally supposed among us that it is only the very
finest silver that admits of being laminated, and so converted
into mirrors. Pure silver was formerly used for the purpose,
but, at the present day, this too has been corrupted by the
devices of fraud. But, really, it is a very marvellous property
that this metal has, of reflecting objects; a property which, it
is generally agreed, results from the repercussion of the air,<a id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a>
thrown back as it is from the metal upon the eyes. The
same too is the action that takes place when we use a mirror.
If, again, a thick plate of this metal is highly polished, and is
rendered slightly concave,<a id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a> the image or object reflected is
enlarged to an immense extent; so vast is the difference between
a surface receiving,<a id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a> and throwing back the air. Even
more than this‚Äîdrinking-cups are now made in such a
manner, as to be filled inside with numerous<a id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a> concave facets,
like so many mirrors; so that if but one person looks into the
interior, he sees reflected a whole multitude of persons.</p>

<p>Mirrors, too, have been invented to reflect monstrous<a id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a>
forms; those, for instance, which have been consecrated in the
Temple at Smyrna. This, however, all results from the configuration
given to the metal; and it makes all the difference
whether the surface has a concave form like the section of a
drinking cup, or whether it is [convex] like a Thracian<a id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a>
buckler; whether it is depressed in the middle or elevated;
whether the surface has a direction<a id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a> transversely or obliquely;
or whether it runs horizontally or vertically; the
peculiar configuration of the surface which receives the shadows,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>causing them to undergo corresponding distortions: for, in
fact, the image is nothing else but the shadow of the object
collected upon the bright surface of the metal.</p>

<p>However, to finish our description of mirrors on the present<a id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a>
occasion‚Äîthe best, in the times of our ancestors, were those of
Brundisium,<a id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a> composed of a mixture of<a id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a> stannum and copper:
at a later period, however, those made of silver were preferred,
Pasiteles<a id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a> being the first who made them, in the time<a id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a>
of Pompeius Magnus. More recently,<a id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a> a notion has arisen
that the object is reflected with greater distinctness, by the
application to the back of the mirror of a layer of gold.<a id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a></p>

may see represented in them their god Anubis;<a id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a> and it is the
custom with them to paint,<a id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a> and not to chase, their silver.
This usage has now passed to our own triumphal statues even;
and, a truly marvellous fact, the value of silver has been
enhanced by deadening its brilliancy.<a id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a> The following is the
method adopted: with the silver are mixed two-thirds of the
very finest Cyprian copper, that known as ‚Äúcoronarium,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a>
and a proportion of live sulphur equal to that of the silver.
The whole of these are then melted in an earthen vessel well
luted with potter‚Äôs clay, the operation being completed when
the cover becomes detached from the vessel. Silver admits
also of being blackened with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg; a
tint, however, which is removed by the application of vinegar
and chalk.</p>

<p>The Triumvir Antonius alloyed the silver denarius with
iron: and in spurious coin there is an alloy of copper employed.
Some, again, curtail<a id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a> the proper weight of our denarii,
the legitimate proportion being eighty-four denarii to a
pound of silver. It was in consequence of these frauds that a
method was devised of assaying the denarius: the law ordaining
which was so much to the taste of the plebeians, that in
every quarter of the City there was a full-length statue
erected<a id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a> in honour of Marius Gratidianus. It is truly marvellous,

<p>The ancients bad no number whereby to express a larger

be it known to all, that the man who first received this surname
became a bankrupt and so bubbled his creditors.<a id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a> M.
Crassus,<a id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a> a member of the same family, used to say that no
man was rich, who could not maintain a legion upon his yearly
income. He possessed in land two hundred millions<a id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a> of
sesterces, being the richest Roman citizen next to Sylla. Nor
was even this enough for him, but he must want to possess all
the gold of the Parthians too!<a id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a> And yet, although he was the
first to become memorable for his opulence‚Äîso pleasant is the
task of stigmatizing this insatiate cupidity‚Äîwe have known
of many manumitted slaves, since his time, much more
wealthy than he ever was; three for example, all at the same

and Narcissus.<a id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a></p>

<p>But to omit all further mention of these men, as though
they were still<a id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a> the rulers of the empire, let us turn to C.
C√¶cilius Claudius Isidorus, who, in the consulship of C.
Asinius Gallus and C. Marcius Censorinus,<a id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a> upon the sixth
day before the calends of February, declared by his will, that
though he had suffered great losses through the civil wars, he
was still able to leave behind him four thousand one hundred
and sixteen slaves, three thousand six hundred pairs of oxen,
and two hundred and fifty-seven thousand heads of other kind
of cattle, besides, in ready money, sixty millions of sesterces.
Upon his funeral, also, he ordered eleven hundred thousand
sesterces to be expended.</p>

<p>And yet, supposing all these enormous riches to be added
together, how small a proportion will they bear to the wealth
of Ptolem√¶us; the person who, according to Varro, when
Pompeius was on his expedition in the countries adjoining
Jud√¶a, entertained eight thousand horsemen at his own expense,
and gave a repast to one thousand guests, setting before
every one of them a drinking-cup of gold, and changing these
vessels at every course! And then, again, how insignificant
would his wealth have been by the side of that of Pythius
the Bithynian<a id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a>‚Äîfor I here make no mention of kings, be it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>remarked. He it was who gave the celebrated plane-tree and
vine of gold to King Darius, and who entertained at a
banquet the troops of Xerxes, seven hundred and eighty-eight
thousand men in all; with a promise of pay and corn
for the whole of them during the next five months, on condition
that one at least of his five children, who had been
drawn for service, should be left to him as the solace of his old
age. And yet, let any one compare the wealth of Pythius to
that possessed by King Cr≈ìsus!</p>

<p>In the name of all that is unfortunate, what madness it is
for human nature to centre its desires upon a thing that has
either fallen to the lot of slaves, or else has reached no known
limit in the aspirations even of kings!</p>

<p>The younger Scipio Africanus left to his heir thirty-two
pounds‚Äô weight of silver; the same person who, on his triumph
over the Carthaginians, displayed four thousand three hundred
and seventy pounds‚Äô weight of that metal. Such was the sum
total of the silver possessed by the whole of the inhabitants of
Carthage, that rival of Rome for the empire of the world!
How many a Roman since then has surpassed her in his display
of plate for a single table! After the destruction of
Numantia, the same Africanus gave to his soldiers, on the
day of his triumph, a largess of seven denarii each‚Äîand right
worthy were they of such a general, when satisfied with such
a sum! His brother, Scipio Allobrogicus,<a id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a> was the very
first who possessed one thousand pounds‚Äô weight of silver,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>but Drusus Livius, when he was tribune of the people, possessed
ten thousand. As to the fact that an ancient warrior,<a id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a> a man,
too, who had enjoyed a triumph, should have incurred the notice

present day.<a id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a> The same, too, with the instance of Catus
√Ülius,<a id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a> who, when consul, after being found by the √Ütolian
ambassadors taking his morning meal<a id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a> off of common earthenware,
refused to receive the silver vessels which they sent him;
and, indeed, was never in possession, to the last day of his
life, of any silver at all, with the exception of two drinking-cups,
which had been presented to him as the reward of his
valour, by L. Paulus,<a id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a> his father-in-law, on the conquest of
King Perseus.</p>

<p>We read, too, that the Carthaginian ambassadors declared
that no people lived on more amicable terms among themselves
than the Romans, for that wherever they had dined
they had always met with the same<a id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a> silver plate. And yet,
by Hercules! to my own knowledge, Pompeius Paulinus, son
of a Roman of equestrian rank at Arelate,<a id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a> a member, too, of
a family, on the paternal side, that was graced with the fur,<a id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a>
had with him, when serving with the army, and that, too, in
a war against the most savage nations, a service of silver plate
that weighed twelve thousand pounds!</p>

<p>For this long time past, however, it has been the fashion to
plate the couches of our women, as well as some of our banquetting-couches,<a id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a>
entirely with silver. Carvilius Pollio,<a id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a> a
Roman of equestrian rank, was the first, it is said, to adorn
these last with silver; not, I mean, to plate them all over, nor
yet to make them after the Delian pattern; the Punic<a id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a> fashion
being the one he adopted. It was after this last pattern too,
that he had them ornamented with gold as well: and it was
not long after his time that silver couches came into fashion,
in imitation of the couches of Delos. All this extravagance,
however, was fully expiated by the civil wars of Sulla.</p>

SIZE WERE FIRST MADE. WHEN SILVER WAS FIRST USED AS
A MATERIAL FOR SIDEBOARDS. WHEN THE SIDEBOARDS CALLED

<p>In fact, it was but very shortly before that period that these
couches were invented, as well as chargers<a id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a> of silver, one
hundred pounds in weight: of which last, it is a well-known
fact, that there were then upwards of one hundred and fifty in
Rome, and that many persons were proscribed through the
devices of others who were desirous to gain possession thereof.
Well may our Annals be put to the blush for having to impute
those civil wars to the existence of such vices as these!</p>

<p>Our own age, however, has waxed even stronger in this
respect. In the reign of Claudius, his slave Drusillanus,
surnamed Rotundus, who acted as his steward<a id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a> in Nearer
Spain, possessed a silver charger weighing five hundred
pounds, for the manufacture of which a workshop had had to be
expressly built. This charger was accompanied also by eight
other dishes, each two hundred and fifty pounds in weight.
How many of his fellow-slaves,<a id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a> pray, would it have taken to
introduce these dishes, or who<a id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a> were to be the guests served
therefrom?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>Cornelius Nepos says that before the victory gained<a id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a> by
Sylla, there were but two banquetting couches adorned with
silver at Rome, and that in his own recollection, silver was
first used for adorning sideboards. Fenestella, who died at the
end of the reign of Tiberius C√¶sar, informs us that at that
period sideboards, inlaid even with tortoiseshell,<a id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a> had come
into fashion; whereas, a little before his time, they had been
made of solid wood, of a round shape, and not much larger
than our tables. He says, however, that when he was quite
a boy, they had begun to make the sideboards square, and of
different<a id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a> pieces of wood, or else veneered with maple or
citrus:<a id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a> and that at a later period the fashion was introduced
of overlaying the corners and the seams at the joinings with
silver. The name given to them in his youth, he says, was
‚Äútympana;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a> and it was at this period, too, that the chargers
which had been known as ‚Äúmagides‚Äù by the ancients, first
received the name of ‚Äúlances,‚Äù from their resemblance<a id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a> to the
scales of a balance.</p>

CHAP. 53.‚ÄîTHE ENORMOUS PRICE OF SILVER PLATE.</span></h3></div>

<p>It is not, however, only for vast quantities of plate that there
is such a rage among mankind, but even more so, if possible,
for the plate of peculiar artists: and this too, to the exculpation
of our own age, has long been the case. C. Gracchus
possessed some silver dolphins, for which he paid five thousand
sesterces per pound. Lucius Crassus, the orator, paid
for two goblets chased by the hand of the artist Mentor,<a id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a> one
hundred thousand sesterces: but he confessed that for very
shame he never dared use them, as also that he had other
articles of plate in his possession, for which he had paid at
the rate of six thousand sesterces per pound. It was the conquest
of Asia<a id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a> that first introduced luxury into Italy; for we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>find that Lucius Scipio, in his triumphal procession, exhibited
one thousand four hundred pounds‚Äô weight of chased silver,
with golden vessels, the weight of which amounted to one
thousand five hundred pounds. This<a id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a> took place in the year
from the foundation of the City, 565. But that which inflicted
a still more severe blow upon the Roman morals, was
the legacy of Asia,<a id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a> which King Attalus<a id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a> left to the state at
his decease, a legacy which was even more disadvantageous
than the victory of Scipio,<a id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a> in its results. For, upon this
occasion, all scruple was entirely removed, by the eagerness
which existed at Rome, for making purchases at the auction
of the king‚Äôs effects. This took place in the year of the City,
622, the people having learned, during the fifty-seven years
that had intervened, not only to admire, but to covet even,
the opulence of foreign nations. The tastes of the Roman
people had received, too, an immense impulse from the conquest
of Achaia,<a id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a> which, during this interval, in the year of
the City, 608, that nothing might be wanting, had introduced
both statues and pictures. The same epoch, too, that saw the
birth of luxury, witnessed the downfall of Carthage; so that,
by a fatal coincidence, the Roman people, at the same moment,
both acquired a taste for vice and obtained a license
for gratifying it.</p>

<p>Some, too, of the ancients sought to recommend themselves
by this love of excess; for Caius Marius, after his victory over
the Cimbri, drank from a cantharus,<a id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a> it is said, in imitation
of Father Liber;<a id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a> Marius, that ploughman<a id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a> of Arpinum, a

CHAP. 54. (12.)‚ÄîSTATUES OF SILVER.</span></h3></div>

<p>It is generally believed, but erroneously, that silver was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>first employed for making statues of the deified Emperor
Augustus, at a period when adulation was all the fashion:
for I find it stated, that in the triumph celebrated by Pompeius
Magnus there was a silver statue exhibited of Pharnaces, the
first<a id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a> king of Pontus, as also one of Mithridates Eupator,<a id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a>
besides chariots of gold and silver.</p>

<p>Silver, too, has in some instances even supplanted gold; for
the luxurious tastes of the female plebeians having gone so far
as to adopt the use of shoe-buckles of gold,<a id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a> it is considered old-fashioned
to wear them made of that metal.<a id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a> I myself, too,
have seen Arellius Fuscus<a id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a>‚Äîthe person whose name was erased
from the equestrian order on a singularly calumnious charge,<a id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a>
when his school was so thronged by our youth, attracted
thither by his celebrity‚Äîwearing rings made of silver. But
of what use is it to collect all these instances, when our very
soldiers, holding ivory even in contempt, have the hilts of
their swords made of chased silver? when, too, their scabbards
are heard to jingle with their silver chains, and their belts
with the plates of silver with which they are inlaid?</p>

<p>At the present day, too, the continence of our very pages is
secured by the aid of silver:<a id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a> our women, when bathing,
quite despise any sitting-bath that is not made of silver:
while for serving up food at table, as well as for the most
unseemly purposes, the same metal must be equally employed!
Would that Fabricius could behold these instances of luxuriousness,
the baths of our women‚Äîbathing as they do in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>company with the men‚Äîpaved with silver to such an extent
that there is not room left for the sole of the foot even!
Fabricius, I say, who would allow of no general of an army
having any other plate than a patera and a salt-cellar of silver.‚ÄîOh
that he could see how that the rewards of valour in our
day are either composed of these objects of luxury, or else
are broken up to make them!<a id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a> Alas for the morals of our

CHAP. 55.‚ÄîTHE MOST REMARKABLE WORKS IN SILVER, AND THE
NAMES OF THE MOST FAMOUS ARTISTS IN SILVER.</span></h3></div>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the art of chasing gold should
have conferred no celebrity upon any person, while that of
embossing silver has rendered many illustrious. The greatest
renown, however, has been acquired by Mentor, of whom
mention has been made already.<a id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a> Four pairs [of vases] were
all that were ever<a id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a> made by him; and at the present day, not
one of these, it is said, is any longer in existence, owing to
the conflagrations of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus and of
that in the Capitol.<a id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a> Varro informs us in his writings that he
also was in possession of a bronze statue, the work of this
artist. Next to Mentor, the most admired artists were Acragas,<a id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>Bo√´thus,<a id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a> and Mys.<a id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a> Works of all these artists are still
extant in the Isle of Rhodes; of Bo√´thus, in the Temple of
Minerva, at Lindus; of Acragas, in the Temple of Father
Liber, at Rhodes, consisting of cups engraved with figures in
relief of Centaurs and Bacchantes; and of Mys, in the same
temple, figures of Sileni and Cupids. Representations also
of the chase by Acragas on drinking cups were held in high
estimation.</p>

<p>Next to these in repute comes Calamis.<a id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a> Antipater<a id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a> too, it

upon a drinking-bowl.<a id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a> Next to these come Stratonicus<a id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a> of
Cyzicus, and Tauriscus:<a id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a> Ariston<a id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a> also, and Eunicus,<a id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a> of
Mytilene are highly praised; Hecat√¶us<a id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a> also, and, about the
age of Pompeius Magnus, Pasiteles,<a id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a> Posidonius<a id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a> of Ephesus,
Hedystratides<a id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a> who engraved battle-scenes and armed warriors,
and Zopyrus,<a id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a> who represented the Court of the Areopagus

thousand sesterces. There was Pytheas<a id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a> also, a work of
whose sold at the rate of ten thousand denarii for two
ounces: it was a drinking-bowl, the figures on which represented
Ulysses and Diomedes stealing the Palladium.<a id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a> The
same artist engraved also, upon some small drinking-vessels,
kitchen scenes,<a id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a> known as ‚Äúmagiriscia;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a> of such remarkably
fine workmanship and so liable to injury, that it was quite
impossible to take copies<a id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a> of them. Teucer too, the inlayer,<a id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a>
enjoyed a great reputation.</p>

<p>All at once, however, this art became so lost in point of
excellence, that at the present day ancient specimens are the
only ones at all valued; and only those pieces of plate are held
in esteem the designs on which are so much worn that the
figures cannot be distinguished.</p>

<p>Silver becomes tainted by the contact of mineral waters,
and of the salt exhalations from them, as in the interior of
Spain, for instance.</p>

CHAP. 56.‚ÄîSIL: THE PERSONS WHO FIRST USED IT IN PAINTING,
AND THE METHOD THEY ADOPTED.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the mines of gold and silver there are some other pigments
also found, sil<a id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a> and c√¶ruleum. Sil is, properly speaking,
a sort of slime.<a id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a> The best kind is that known as Attic
sil; the price of which is two denarii per pound. The next best
kind is the marbled<a id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a> sil, the price of which is half that of the
Attic kind. A third sort is the compressed sil, known to some
persons as Scyric sil, it coming from the Isle of Scyros.
Then, too, there is the sil of Achaia, which painters make use
of for shadow-painting, and the price of which is two sesterces
per pound. At a price of two asses less per pound, is sold the
clear<a id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>sil, which comes from Gaul. This last kind, as well as
the Attic sil, is used for painting strong lights: but the marbled
sil only is employed for colouring compartitions,<a id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a> the
marble in it offering a resistance to the natural acridity of the
lime. This last kind is extracted also from some mountains
twenty miles distant from the City. When thus extracted,
it is submitted to the action of fire; in which form it is adulterated
by some, and sold for compressed sil. That it has been
burnt, however, and adulterated, may be very easily detected by
its acridity, and the fact that it very soon crumbles into dust.</p>

<p>Polygnotus<a id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a> and Micon<a id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a> were the first to employ sil in
painting, but that of Attica solely. The succeeding age used
this last kind for strong lights only, and employed the Scyric
and Lydian kinds for shadow painting. The Lydian sil used
to be bought at Sardes; but at the present day we hear
nothing of it.</p>

<p>C√¶ruleum<a id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a> is a kind of sand. In former times there were
three kinds of it; the Egyptian, which was the most esteemed
of all; the Scythian, which is easily dissolved, and which
produces four colours when pounded, one of a lighter blue
and one of a darker blue, one of a thicker consistency and
one comparatively thin;<a id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a> and the Cyprian, which is now preferred
as a colour to the preceding. Since then, the kinds
imported from Puteoli and Spain have been added to the list,
this sand having of late been prepared there. Every kind,<a id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>however, is submitted to a dyeing process, it being boiled with
a plant<a id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a> used particularly for this purpose,<a id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a> and imbibing its
juices. In other respects, the mode of preparing it is similar
to that of chrysocolla. From c√¶ruleum, too, is prepared the
substance known as ‚Äúlomentum,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a> it being washed and
ground for the purpose. Lomentum is of a paler tint than
c√¶ruleum; the price of it is ten denarii per pound, and that
of c√¶ruleum but eight. C√¶ruleum is used upon a surface
of clay, for upon lime it will not hold. A more recent
invention is the Vestorian<a id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a> c√¶ruleum, so called from the
person who first manufactured it: it is prepared from the finer
parts of Egyptian c√¶ruleum, and the price of it is eleven
denarii per pound. That of Puteoli is used in a similar

Rome, the price being seventeen<a id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a> denarii per pound. Painters
make use of it for incisures, or in other words, the division of
shadows from light. There is also a lomentum of very inferior
quality, known to us as ‚Äúground‚Äù lomentum, and valued
at only five asses per pound.</p>

<p>The mode of testing the genuineness of c√¶ruleum, is to see
whether it emits a flame, on being laid upon burning coals.
One method of adulterating it is to boil dried violets in water,
and then to strain the liquor through linen into Eretrian<a id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a>

<p>C√¶ruleum has the medicinal property of acting as a detergent
upon ulcers. Hence it is, that it is used as an ingredient
in plasters, as also in cauteries. As to sil, it is pounded with
the greatest difficulty: viewed as a medicament, it is slightly
mordent and astringent, and fills up the cavities left by ulcers.
To make it the more serviceable, it is burnt in earthen
vessels.</p>

<p>The prices of things, which I have in different places
annexed, vary, I am well aware, according to the locality, and
experience a change almost every year: variations dependent
upon the opportunities afforded for navigation, and the terms
upon which the merchant may have purchased the article. It
may so happen, too, that some wealthy dealer has engrossed
the market, and so enhanced the price: for I am by no means
forgetful of the case of Demetrius, who in the reign of the
Emperor Nero was accused before the consuls by the whole
community of the Seplasia.<a id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a> Still, however, I have thought

indeed the Corinthian brass comes before silver, not to say
almost before gold itself. It is also, as I have stated above,<a id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a>
the standard of monetary value;<a id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a> hence the terms ‚Äú√¶ra militum,‚Äù

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>another ancient fact which proves that the esteem in which it
was held was of equal antiquity with that of the City itself,
the circumstance that the third associated body<a id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a> which Numa

CHAP. 2.‚ÄîTHE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COPPER.</span></h3></div>

<p>The ore is extracted in the mode that has been described
above,<a id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a> and is then purified by fusion. The metal is also
obtained from a coppery stone called ‚Äúcadmia.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a> The most
highly esteemed copper is procured from beyond seas: it was
formerly obtained in Campania also, and at present is found in
the country of the Bergomates,<a id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a> at the extremity of Italy.
It is said to have been lately discovered also in the province of
Germany.</p>

<p>(2.) In Cyprus, where copper was first discovered, it is also procured
from another stone, which is called ‚Äúchalcitis.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a> This,
however, was afterwards considered of little value, a better
kind having been found in other regions, especially that called
‚Äúaurichalcum,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a> which was long in high request, on account of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>its excellent quality; but none of it has been found for this
long time, the earth having been quite exhausted. The kind
which was next in value was the Sallustian,<a id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a> procured from
the Alpine district of the Centrones;<a id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a> but this did not last
long, and was succeeded by the Livian, in Gaul. They both
took their names from the owners of the mines; the former a
friend of the Emperor Augustus, the latter that emperor‚Äôs
wife.<a id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a> They soon failed, however, and in the Livian even
there is now found but a very small quantity of ore. That
which is at present held in the highest estimation is the
Marian, likewise known as the Corduban;<a id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a> next to the Livian,
this kind most readily absorbs cadmia, and becomes almost as
excellent as aurichalcum<a id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a> for making sesterces and double
asses,<a id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a> the Cyprian copper being thought good enough for the
as. Thus much concerning the natural qualities of this metal.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_3"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 3.‚ÄîTHE CORINTHIAN BRASS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The other kinds are made artificially, all of which will be
described in the appropriate places, the more celebrated kinds
first coming under our notice. Formerly a mixture was made
of copper fused with gold and silver, and the workmanship in
this metal was considered even more valuable than the material
itself; but, at the present day, it is difficult to say
whether the workmanship in it, or the material, is the worst.
Indeed, it is wonderful, that while the value of these works<a id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>has so infinitely increased, the reputation of the art itself<a id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a> is
nearly extinct. But it would appear, that in this, as in every
thing else, what was formerly done for the sake of reputation,
is now undertaken for the mere purpose of gain. For
whereas this art was ascribed to the gods<a id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a> themselves, and
men of rank in all countries endeavoured to acquire fame by
the practice of it, we have now so entirely lost the method of
making this valuable compound by fusion, that, for this long
time past, not even chance itself has assumed, in this department,
the privilege which formerly belonged to art.<a id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a></p>

<p>Next after the above compound, so celebrated in antiquity,
the Corinthian metal has been the most highly esteemed. This
was a compound produced by accident, when Corinth was burnt
at the time of its capture.<a id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a> There has been a wonderful mania
with many for gaining possession of this metal. It is even said,
that Verres, whom M. Cicero caused to be condemned, was
proscribed by Antonius, along with Cicero, for no other reason
than his refusal to give up some specimens of Corinthian metal,
which were in his possession. But most of these people seem
to me to make a pretence of their discernment in reference to
this metal, rather for the purpose of distinguishing themselves
from the multitude, than from any real knowledge which they
possess; and this I will briefly show.</p>

<p>Corinth was captured in the third year of the 158th
Olympiad, being the year of the City, 608,<a id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a> some ages after the
period when those artists flourished, who produced all the
specimens of what these persons now call Corinthian metal.
It is in order, therefore, to refute this opinion, that I shall
state the age when these different artists lived; for, if we
reckon according to the above-mentioned era of the Olympiads,
it will be easy to compare their dates with the corresponding
years of our City. The only genuine Corinthian vessels, then,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>are those which these men of taste metamorphose, sometimes
into dishes, sometimes into lamps, or even into washing-basins,<a id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a>
without any regard to decency. They are of three
kinds; the white variety, approaching very nearly to the
splendour of silver, and in which that metal forms a large
proportion of the compound; a second kind, in which the
yellow colour of gold predominates; and a third, in which all
the metals are mixed in equal proportions. Besides these,
there is another mixture, the composition of which it is impossible
to describe, for although it has been formed into
images and statues by the hand of man, it is chance that rules
in the formation of the compound. This last is highly prized
for its colour, which approaches to that of liver, and it is
on this account that it is called ‚Äúhepatizon:‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a> it is far inferior
to the Corinthian metal, but much superior to the
√Üginetan and Delian, which long held the first rank.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_4"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 4.‚ÄîTHE DELIAN BRASS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The Delian brass was the first<a id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a> that became famous, all the
world coming to Delos to purchase it; and hence the attention
paid to the manufacture of it. It was in this island that
brass first obtained celebrity for the manufacture of the feet
and supports of dining-couches. After some time it came
to be employed for the statues of the gods, and the effigies of
men and other animated beings.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_5"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 5.‚ÄîTHE √ÜGINETAN BRASS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The next most esteemed brass was the √Üginetan; the
island itself being rendered famous for its brass‚Äînot indeed
that the metal was produced there, but because the annealing
of the √Üginetan manufactories was so excellent. A brazen
Ox, which was taken from this island, now stands in the
Forum Boarium<a id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a> at Rome. This is a specimen of the
√Üginetan metal, as the Jupiter in the Temple of Jupiter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>Tonans, in the Capitol, is of the Delian. Myron<a id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a> used the
former metal and Polycletus<a id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a> the latter; they were contemporaries
and fellow-pupils, but there was great rivalry between
them as to their materials.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_6"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 6. (3.)‚ÄîSTANDS FOR LAMPS.</span></h3></div>

<p>√Ügina was particularly famous for the manufacture of
sockets only for lamp-stands, as Tarentum was for that of the
branches;<a id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a> the most complete articles were, therefore, produced
by the union of the two. There are persons, too, who
are not ashamed to give for one a sum equal to the salary of
a military tribune,<a id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a> although, as its name indicates, its only
use is to hold a lighted candle. On the sale of one of these
lamp-stands, Theon the public crier announced, that the purchaser
must also take, as part of the lot, one Clesippus, a
fuller, who was hump-backed, and in other respects, of a
hideous aspect. The purchase was made by a female named<a id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a>
Gegania, for fifty thousand sesterces. Upon her exhibiting
these purchases at an entertainment which she gave, the
slave, for the amusement of her guests, was brought in naked.
Conceiving an infamous passion for him, she first admitted
him to her bed, and finally left him all her estate. Having
thus become excessively rich, he adored the lamp-stand as
much as any divinity, and the story became a sort of pendant
to the celebrity of the Corinthian lamp-stands. Still, however,
good morals were vindicated in the end, for he erected a
splendid monument to her memory, and so kept alive the eternal
remembrance of the misconduct of Gegania. But although
it is well known that there are no lamp-stands in existence
made of the Corinthian metal, yet this name is very generally
attached to them, because, in consequence of the victory of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>Mummius,<a id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a> Corinth was destroyed: at the same time, however,
it should be remembered that this victory dispersed a number
of bronzes which originally came from many other cities of
Achaia.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_7"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 7.‚ÄîORNAMENTS OF THE TEMPLES MADE OF BRASS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The ancients were in the habit of making the door-sills and
even the doors of the temples of brass. I find it stated, also,
that Cneius Octavius, who obtained a naval triumph over King
Perseus,<a id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a> erected the double portico to the Flaminian Circus,
which was called the ‚ÄúCorinthian‚Äù from the brazen capitals of
the pillars.<a id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a> It is stated also, that an ordinance was made that
the Temple of Vesta<a id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a> should be covered with a coating of
Syracusan metal. The capitals, too, of the pillars, which were
placed by M. Agrippa in the Pantheon, are made of similar
metal. Even the opulence, too, of private individuals has
been wrested to similar purposes. Spurius Carvilius, the
qu√¶stor, among the other charges which he brought against
Camillus,<a id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a> accused him of having brazen doors in his house.</p>

<p>We learn from L. Piso,<a id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a> that Cneius Manlius was the first who
introduced brazen banquetting-couches, buffets, and tables

learn from Antias,<a id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a> that the heirs of L. Crassus, the orator,
sold a number of banquetting-couches adorned with brass. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>tripods,<a id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">1256</a> which were called Delphian, because they were
devoted more particularly to receiving the offerings that were
presented to the Delphian Apollo, were usually made of brass:
also the pendant lamps,<a id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a> so much admired, which were placed
in the temples, or gave their light in the form of trees loaded
with fruit; such as the one, for instance, in the Temple of the
Palatine Apollo,<a id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a> which Alexander the Great, at the sacking

CHAP. 9. (4.)‚ÄîWHICH WAS THE FIRST STATUE OF A GOD MADE OF
BRASS AT ROME. THE ORIGIN OF STATUES, AND THE RESPECT
PAID TO THEM.</span></h3></div>

<p>But after some time the artists everywhere applied themselves
to representations of the gods. I find that the first
brass image, which was made at Rome, was that of Ceres;
and that the expenses were defrayed out of the property that
belonged to Spurius Cassius, who was put to death by his own
father, for aspiring to the regal office.<a id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a> The practice, however,
soon passed from the gods to the statues and representations
of men, and this in various forms. The ancients stained
their statues with bitumen, which makes it the more remarkable
that they were afterwards fond of covering them with
gold. I do not know whether this was a Roman invention;
but it certainly has the repute of being an ancient practice at
Rome.</p>

<p>It was not the custom in former times to give the likeness
of individuals, except of such as deserved to be held in lasting
remembrance on account of some illustrious deed; in the first
instance, for a victory at the sacred games, and more particularly
the Olympic Games, where it was the usage for the victors
always to have their statues consecrated. And if any one was
so fortunate as to obtain the prize there three times, his statue
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>was made with the exact resemblance of every individual
limb; from which circumstance they were called ‚Äúiconic√¶.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">1261</a>
I do not know whether the first public statues were not erected
by the Athenians, and in honour of Harmodius and Aristogiton,
who slew the tyrant;<a id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a> an event which took place in
the same year in which the kings were expelled from Rome.
This custom, from a most praiseworthy emulation, was afterwards
adopted by all other nations; so that statues were
erected as ornaments in the public places of municipal towns,
and the memory of individuals was thus preserved, their
various honours being inscribed on the pedestals, to be read
there by posterity, and not on their tombs alone. After some
time, a kind of forum or public place came to be made in private
houses and in our halls, the clients adopting this method
of doing honour to their patrons.</p>

CHAP. 10. (5.)‚ÄîTHE DIFFERENT KINDS AND FORMS OF STATUES.
STATUES AT ROME WITH CUIRASSES.</span></h3></div>

<p>In former times the statues that were thus dedicated were
clad in the toga.<a id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a> Naked statues also, brandishing a spear,
after the manner of the youths at their gymnastic exercises,
were much admired; these were called ‚ÄúAchillean.‚Äù The
Greek practice is, not to cover any part of the body; while,
on the contrary, the Roman and the military statues have the
addition of a cuirass. C√¶sar, the Dictator, permitted a statue
with a cuirass to be erected in honour of him in his Forum.<a id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a> As
to the statues which are made in the garb of the Luperci,<a id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a>
they are of no older date than those which have been lately
erected, covered with a cloak.<a id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a> Mancinus gave directions,
that he should be represented in the dress which he wore when
he was surrendered to the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a> It has been remarked by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>some authors, that L. Attius,<a id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">1268</a> the poet, had a statue of himself
erected in the Temple of the Muses,<a id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">1269</a> which was extremely
large, although he himself was very short.</p>

<p>Equestrian statues are also held in esteem in Rome; but
they are of Greek origin, no doubt. Among the Greeks, those
persons only were honoured with equestrian statues who were
victors on horseback<a id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">1270</a> in the sacred games; though afterwards
the same distinction was bestowed on those who were successful
in the races with chariots with two or four horses: hence
the use of chariots with us in the statues of those who have
triumphed. But this did not take place until a late period;
and it was not until the time of the late Emperor Augustus,
that we had chariots represented with six horses,<a id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">1271</a> as also with
elephants.</p>

CHAP. 11.‚ÄîIN HONOUR OF WHOM PUBLIC STATUES WERE FIRST
ERECTED: IN HONOUR OF WHOM THEY WERE FIRST PLACED ON
PILLARS: WHEN THE ROSTRA WERE FIRST ERECTED.</span></h3></div>

<p>The custom of erecting chariots with two horses in honour
of those who had discharged the office of pr√¶tor, and had
passed round the Circus in a chariot, is not of ancient date.
That of placing statues on pillars is older, as it was done in
honour of C. M√¶nius,<a id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">1272</a> who conquered the ancient Latins, to
whom the Romans by treaty gave one third of the spoil which
they had obtained. It was in the same consulship also, that the
‚Äúrostra‚Äù or beaks of the ships, which had been taken from
the Antiates when vanquished, were fixed to the tribunal; it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>being the year of the City, 416.<a id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">1273</a> The same thing was done
also by Caius Duillius, who was the first to obtain a naval
triumph over the Carthaginians: his column still remains
in the Forum.<a id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a> I am not certain whether this honour was not
first conferred by the people on L. Minutius, the pr√¶fect of the
markets; whose statue was erected without the Trigeminian
Gate,<a id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a> by means of a tax of the twelfth of an as<a id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a> per head:
the same thing, however, had been previously done by the
senate, and it would have been a more distinguished honour
had it not had its origin on such frivolous occasions. The
statue of Attus Navius,<a id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a> for example, was erected before the
senate-house, the pedestal of which was consumed when the
senate-house itself was burnt at the funeral of Publius Clodius.<a id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a>
The statue of Hermodorus also, the Ephesian,<a id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a> the
interpreter of the laws which were transcribed by the Decemvirs,
was erected by the public in the Comitium.<a id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a></p>

<p>It was for a very different, and more important reason, that
the statue of Horatius Cocles was erected, he having singly
prevented the enemy from passing the Sublician bridge:<a id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a> a
statue which remains to this day. I am not at all surprized,
too, that statues of the Sibyl should have been erected
near the Rostra, even though three in number; one of which
was repaired by Sextus Pacuvius Taurus, √¶dile of the people,
and the other two by M. Messala. I should have considered these
and that of Attus Navius to have been the oldest, as having
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>been placed there in the time of Tarquinius Priscus, had there
not been in the Capitol the statues of the preceding kings.<a id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a></p>

<p>(6.) Among these we have the statues of Romulus and
Tatius without the tunic; as also that of Camillus, near the
Rostra. The equestrian statue of Marcius Tremulus, clad in the
toga, stood before the Temple of the Castors;<a id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a> him who twice
subdued the Samnites, and by the capture of Anagnia delivered
the people from their tribute.<a id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a> Among the most ancient are
those of Tullus Cl≈ìlius, Lucius Roscius, Spurius Nautius,
and C. Fulcinus, near the Rostra, all of whom were assassinated
by the Fidenates, when on their mission as ambassadors.<a id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a>
It was the custom with the republic to confer this
honour on those who had been unjustly put to death; such as P.
Junius, also, and Titus Coruncanius, who were slain by Teuta,
queen of the Illyrians.<a id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a> It would be wrong not to mention
what is stated in the Annals, that their statues, erected in
the Forum, were three feet in height; whence it would appear
that such were the dimensions of these marks of honour in
those times.</p>

<p>Nor must I forget to mention Cneius Octavius, on account of
the language used by the Senate.<a id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a> When King Antiochus
said, that he would give him an answer at another time, Octavius
drew a line round him with a stick, which he happened
to have in his hand, and compelled him to give an answer
before he allowed him to step beyond the circle. Octavius
being slain<a id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">1288</a> while on this embassy, the senate ordered his
statue to be placed in the most conspicuous<a id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">1289</a> spot; and that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>spot was the Rostra. A statue appears also to have been decreed
to Taracia Caia, or Furetia, a Vestal Virgin, the same, too, to be
placed wherever she might think fit; an additional honour, no
less remarkable, it is thought, than the grant itself of a statue to
a female. I will state her merits in the words of the Annals:
‚ÄúBecause she had gratuitously presented to the public the field
bordering on the Tiber.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">1290</a></p>

CHAP. 12.‚ÄîIN HONOUR OF WHAT FOREIGNERS PUBLIC STATUES
WERE ERECTED AT ROME.</span></h3></div>

<p>I find also, that statues were erected in honour of Pythagoras
and of Alcibiades, in the corners of the Comitium; in obedience
to the command of the Pythian Apollo, who, in the
Samnite War,<a id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a> had directed that statues of the bravest and
the wisest of the Greeks should be erected in some conspicuous
spot: and here they remained until Sylla, the Dictator,
built the senate-house on the site. It is wonderful that the
senate should then have preferred Pythagoras to Socrates, who,
in consequence of his wisdom, had been preferred to all other
men<a id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a> by the god himself; as, also, that they should have preferred
Alcibiades for valour to so many other heroes; or, indeed,
any one to Themistocles, who so greatly excelled in both qualities.
The reason of the statues being raised on columns, was,
that the persons represented might be elevated above other
mortals; the same thing being signified by the use of arches,
a new invention which had its origin among the Greeks. I
am of opinion that there is no one to whom more statues were
erected than to Demetrius Phalercus<a id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a> at Athens: for there
were three hundred and sixty erected in his honour, there
being reckoned at that period no more days in the year: these,
however, were soon broken to pieces. The different tribes
erected statues, in all the quarters of Rome, in honour of
Marius Gratidianus, as already stated;<a id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a> but they were all
thrown down by Sylla, when he entered Rome.</p>

<p>Pedestrian statues have been, undoubtedly, for a long time
in estimation at Rome: equestrian statues are, however, of
considerable antiquity, and females even have participated in
this honour; for the statue of Cl√¶lia is equestrian,<a id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a> as if it
had not been thought sufficient to have her clad in the toga;
and this, although statues were not decreed to Lucretia, or to
Brutus, who had expelled the kings, and through both of whom
Cl√¶lia had been given as a hostage.<a id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a> I should have thought
that this statue, and that of Cocles, were the first that were
erected at the public expense‚Äîfor it is most likely that the
statues of Attus and the Sibyl were erected by Tarquinius,
and those of each of the other kings by themselves respectively‚Äîhad
not Piso stated that the statue of Cl√¶lia was erected by
those who had been hostages with her, when they were given
up by Porsena, as a mark of honour.</p>

<p>But Annius Fetialis<a id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a> states, on the other hand, that the
equestrian statue, which stood opposite the Temple of Jupiter
Stator, in the vestibule of the house of Tarquinius Superbus,
was that of Valeria,<a id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a> the daughter of the consul Publicola; and
that she was the only person that escaped and swam across
the Tiber; the rest of the hostages that had been sent to
Porsena having been destroyed by a stratagem of Tarquinius.</p>

<p>We are informed by L. Piso, that when M. √Ümilius and C.
Popilius were consuls, for the second time,<a id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a> the censors, P.
Cornelius Scipio and M. Popilius, caused all the statues
erected round the Forum in honour of those who had borne
the office of magistrates, to be removed; with the exception of
those which had been placed there, either by order of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>people or of the senate. The statue also which Spurius
Cassius,<a id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a> who had aspired to the supreme authority, had
erected in honour of himself, before the Temple of Tellus, was
melted down by order of the censors; for even in this respect,
the men of those days took precautions against ambition.</p>

<p>There are still extant some declamations by Cato, during
his censorship, against the practice of erecting statues of
women in the Roman provinces. However, he could not
prevent these statues being erected at Rome even; to Cornelia,
for instance, the mother of the Gracchi, and daughter of the
elder Scipio Africanus. She is represented in a sitting posture,
and the statue is remarkable for having no straps to the
shoes. This statue, which was formerly in the public Portico
of Metellus, is now in the Buildings of Octavia.<a id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a></p>

for having twice attacked Thurii: on which account

and a golden crown. At a later period, the same people
erected a statue to Fabricius,<a id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a>  who had delivered their city
from a state of siege. From time to time various nations
thus placed themselves under the protection of the Romans;
and all distinctions were thereby so effectually removed, that
statues of Hannibal even are to be seen in three different
places in that city, within the walls of which, he alone of all
its enemies, had hurled his spear.<a id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a></p>

CHAP. 16. (7.)‚ÄîTHAT THERE WERE STATUARIES IN ITALY ALSO
AT AN EARLY PERIOD.</span></h3></div>

<p>Various circumstances prove, that the art of making statues
was commonly practised in Italy at an early period. The
statue in the Cattle Market<a id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a> is said to have been consecrated
to Hercules by Evander; it is called the triumphal Hercules,
and, on the occasion of triumphal processions, is arrayed in
triumphal vestments. And then besides, King Numa dedicated
the statue of the two-faced Janus;<a id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a> a deity who is
worshipped as presiding over both peace and war. The
fingers, too, are so formed as to indicate three hundred and
sixty-five days,<a id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a> or in other words, the year; thus denoting
that he is the god of time and duration.</p>

<p>There are also Etruscan statues dispersed in various parts
of the world, which beyond a doubt were originally made in
Etruria. I should have supposed that these had been the
statues only of divinities, had not Metrodorus<a id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a> of Scepsis, who
had his surname from his hatred to the Roman name,<a id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a> reproached
us with having pillaged the city of Volsinii for the
sake of the two thousand statues which it contained. It
appears to me a singular fact, that although the origin of
statues was of such great antiquity in Italy, the images of the
gods, which were consecrated to them in their temples, should
have been formed either of wood or of earthenware,<a id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a> until
the conquest of Asia, which introduced luxury among us. It
will be the best plan to enlarge upon the origin of the art of
expressing likenesses, when we come to speak of what the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>Greeks call ‚Äúplastice;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a> for the art of modelling was prior to
that of statuary. This last, however, has flourished to such an
extraordinary degree, that an account of it would fill many
volumes, if we were desirous of making an extensive acquaintance
with the subject: but as to learning everything connected
with it, who could do it?</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_17"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 17.‚ÄîTHE IMMODERATE PRICES OF STATUES.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the √¶dileship of M. Scaurus, there were three thousand
statues erected on the stage of what was a temporary theatre<a id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a>
only. Mummius, the conqueror of Achaia, filled the City
with statues; he who at his death was destined not to leave a
dowry to his daughter,<a id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a> for why not mention this as an
apology for him? The Luculli<a id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">1314</a> also introduced many articles
from abroad. Yet we learn from Mucianus,<a id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a> who was
thrice consul, that there are still three thousand statues in
Rhodes, and it is supposed that there are no fewer in existence
at Athens, at Olympia, and at Delphi. What living
mortal could enumerate them all? or of what utility would
be such information? Still, however, I may, perhaps, afford
amusement by giving some slight account of such of those works
of art as are in any way remarkable, and stating the names of
the more celebrated artists. Of each of these it would be
impossible to enumerate all the productions, for Lysippus<a id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a>
alone is said to have executed no less than fifteen hundred<a id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a>
works of art, all of which were of such excellence that any
one of them might have immortalized him. The number was
ascertained by his heir, upon opening his coffers after his
death, it having been his practice to lay up one golden
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>denarius<a id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a> out of the sum which he had received as the price
of each statue.</p>

<p>This art has arrived at incredible perfection, both in successfulness
and in boldness of design. As a proof of successfulness,
I will adduce one example, and that of a figure which
represented neither god nor man. We have seen in our own
time, in the Capitol, before it was last burnt by the party<a id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a> of
Vitellius, in the shrine of Juno there, a bronze figure of a dog
licking its wounds. Its miraculous excellence and its perfect
truthfulness were not only proved by the circumstance of its
having been consecrated there, but also by the novel kind of
security that was taken for its safety; for, no sum appearing
equal to its value, it was publicly enacted that the keepers of
it should be answerable for its safety with their lives.</p>

CHAP. 18.‚ÄîTHE MOST CELEBRATED COLOSSAL STATUES IN THE
CITY.</span></h3></div>

<p>As to boldness of design, the examples are innumerable;
for we see designed, statues of enormous bulk, known as
colossal statues and equal to towers in size. Such, for
instance, is the Apollo in the Capitol, which was brought by
M. Lucullus from Apollonia, a city of Pontus,<a id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">1320</a> thirty cubits
in height, and which cost five hundred talents: such, too, is
the statue of Jupiter, in the Campus Martius, dedicated by
the late Emperor Claudius, but which appears small in comparison
from its vicinity to the Theatre of Pompeius: and such
is that at Tarentum, forty cubits in height, and the work of
Lysippus.<a id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a> It is a remarkable circumstance in this statue,
that though, as it is stated, it is so nicely balanced as to be
moveable by the hand, it has never been thrown down by a
tempest. This indeed, the artist, it is said, has guarded
against, by a column erected at a short distance from it,
upon the side on which the violence of the wind required
to be broken. On account, therefore, of its magnitude, and
the great difficulty of moving it, Fabius Verrucosus<a id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">1322</a> did not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>touch it, when he transferred the Hercules from that place to
the Capitol, where it now stands.</p>

<p>But that which is by far the most worthy of our admiration,
is the colossal statue of the Sun, which stood formerly at
Rhodes, and was the work of Chares the Lindian, a pupil
of the above-named Lysippus;<a id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">1323</a> no less than seventy cubits in
height. This statue, fifty-six years after it was erected, was
thrown down by an earthquake; but even as it lies, it excites
our wonder and admiration.<a id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a> Few men can clasp the thumb
in their arms, and its fingers are larger than most statues.
Where the limbs are broken asunder, vast caverns are seen
yawning in the interior. Within it, too, are to be seen large
masses of rock, by the weight of which the artist steadied it
while erecting it. It is said that it was twelve years before
this statue was completed, and that three hundred talents were
expended upon it; a sum raised from the engines of warfare
which had been abandoned by King Demetrius,<a id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">1325</a> when tired
of the long-protracted siege of Rhodes. In the same city
there are other colossal statues, one hundred in number; but
though smaller than the one already mentioned, wherever
erected, they would, any one of them, have ennobled the place.
In addition to these, there are five colossal statues of the gods,
which were made by Bryaxis.<a id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">1326</a></p>

<p>Colossal statues used also to be made in Italy. At all events,
we see the Tuscan Apollo, in the library of the Temple of
Augustus,<a id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">1327</a> fifty feet in height from the toe; and it is a question
whether it is more remarkable for the quality of the metal, or
for the beauty of the workmanship. Spurius Carvilius also
erected the statue of Jupiter which is seen in the Capitol, after he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>had conquered the Samnites,<a id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">1328</a> who fought in obedience to a most
solemn oath; it being formed out of their breast-plates, greaves,
and helmets, and of such large dimensions that it may be
seen from the statue of Jupiter Latiaris.<a id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">1329</a> He made his
own statue, which is at the feet of the other one, out of the
filings of the metal. There are also, in the Capitol, two heads
which are very much admired, and which were dedicated by
the Consul P. Lentulus, one of them executed by the above-mentioned
Chares,<a id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">1330</a> the other by Decius;<a id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">1331</a> but this last is so
greatly excelled by the former, as to have all the appearance of
being the work of one of the poorest of artists.</p>

<p>But all these gigantic statues of this kind have been surpassed
in our own age by that of Mercury, made by Zenodotus<a id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">1332</a>
for the city of the Arverni in Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">1333</a> which was ten years in
being completed, and the making of which cost four hundred
thousand sesterces. Having given sufficient proof there
of his artistic skill, he was sent for by Nero to Rome, where
he made a colossal statue intended to represent that prince,
one hundred and ten feet in height. In consequence, however,
of the public detestation of Nero‚Äôs crimes, this statue was consecrated
to the Sun.<a id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">1334</a> We used to admire in his studio, not
only the accurate likeness in the model of clay, but in the
small sketches<a id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">1335</a> also, which served as the first foundation
of the work. This statue proves that the art of fusing
[precious] brass was then lost, for Nero was prepared to furnish
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>the requisite gold and silver, and Zenodotus was inferior to
none of the ancients, either as a designer or as an engraver.<a id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">1336</a>
At the time that he was working at the statue for the Arverni,
he copied for Dubius Avitus, the then governor of the province,
two drinking-cups, chased by the hand of Calamis,<a id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">1337</a> which
had been highly prized by Germanicus C√¶sar, and had been
given by him to his preceptor Cassius Silanus, the uncle of
Avitus; and this with such exactness, that they could scarcely
be distinguished from the originals. The greater, then, the superiority
of Zenodotus, the more certainly it may be concluded
that the secret of fusing [precious] brass is lost.</p>

<p>(8.) Persons who possess what are called Corinthian bronzes,<a id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">1338</a>
are generally so much enamoured of them, as to carry them
about with them from place to place; Hortensius, the orator,
for instance, who possessed a Sphinx, which he had made
Verres give him, when accused. It was to this figure that
Cicero alluded, in an altercation which took place at the trial:
when, upon Hortensius saying that he could not understand
enigmas, Cicero made answer that he ought to understand
them, as he had got a Sphinx<a id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">1339</a> at home. The Emperor Nero,
also, used to carry about with him the figure of an Amazon, of
which I shall speak further hereafter;<a id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">1340</a> and, shortly before this,
C. Cestius, a person of consular<a id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">1341</a> rank, had possessed a figure,
which he carried with him even in battle. The tent, too, of
Alexander the Great was usually supported, it is said, by statues,
two of which are consecrated before the Temple of Mars
Ultor,<a id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">1342</a> and a similar number before the Palace.<a id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">1343</a></p>

CHAP. 19.‚ÄîAN ACCOUNT OF THE MOST CELEBRATED WORKS IN
BRASS, AND OF THE ARTISTS, 366 IN NUMBER.</span></h3></div>

<p>An almost innumerable multitude of artists have been rendered
famous by their statues and figures of smaller size.
Before all others is Phidias,<a id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">1344</a> the Athenian, who executed the
Jupiter at Olympia, in ivory and gold,<a id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">1345</a> but who also made
figures in brass as well. He flourished in the eighty-third
Olympiad, about the year of our City, 300. To the same age
belong also his rivals Alcamenes,<a id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">1346</a> Critias,<a id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">1347</a> Nesiotes,<a id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">1348</a> and
Hegias.<a id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">1349</a> Afterwards, in the eighty-seventh Olympiad, there
were Agelades,<a id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">1350</a> Callon,<a id="FNanchor_1351_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">1351</a> and Gorgias the Laconian. In the
ninetieth Olympiad there were Polycletus,<a id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">1352</a> Phradmon,<a id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">1353</a>
Myron,<a id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">1354</a> Pythagoras,<a id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">1355</a> Scopas,<a id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">1356</a> and Perellus.<a id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">1357</a> Of these,
Polycletus had for pupils, Argius,<a id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">1358</a> Asopodorus, Alexis,
Aristides,<a id="FNanchor_1359_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">1359</a> Phrynon, Dinon, Athenodorus,<a id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">1360</a> and Demeas<a id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">1361</a> the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>Clitorian: Lycius,<a id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">1362</a> too, was the pupil of Myron. In the
ninety-fifth Olympiad flourished Naucsydes,<a id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">1363</a> Dinomenes,<a id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">1364</a>
Canachus,<a id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">1365</a> and Patroclus.<a id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">1366</a> In the hundred and second
Olympiad there were Polycles,<a id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">1367</a> Cephisodotus,<a id="FNanchor_1368_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">1368</a> Leochares,<a id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">1369</a>
and Hypatodorus.<a id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">1370</a> In the hundred and fourth Olympiad,
flourished Praxiteles<a id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">1371</a> and Euphranor;<a id="FNanchor_1372_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">1372</a> in the hundred and

thirteenth, Lysippus,<a id="FNanchor_1375_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">1375</a> who was the contemporary of Alexander
the Great, his brother Lysistratus,<a id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">1376</a> Sthennis,<a id="FNanchor_1377_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">1377</a> Euphron,
Eucles, Sostratus,<a id="FNanchor_1378_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">1378</a> Ion, and Silanion,<a id="FNanchor_1379_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a> who was remarkable for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>having acquired great celebrity without any instructor:
Zeuxis<a id="FNanchor_1380_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">1380</a> was his pupil. In the hundred and twenty-first
Olympiad were Eutychides,<a id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">1381</a> Euthycrates,<a id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">1382</a> La√Øppus,<a id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">1383</a> Cephisodotus,<a id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">1384</a>
Timarchus,<a id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">1385</a> and Pyromachus.<a id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a></p>

<p>The practice of this art then ceased for some time, but
revived in the hundred and fifty-sixth Olympiad, when there
were some artists, who, though far inferior to those already mentioned,
were still highly esteemed; Ant√¶us, Callistratus,<a id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">1387</a> Polycles,<a id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a>
Athen√¶us,<a id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">1389</a> Callixenus, Pythocles, Pythias, and Timocles.<a id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">1390</a></p>

<p>The ages of the most celebrated artists being thus distinguished,
I shall cursorily review the more eminent of them,
the greater part being mentioned in a desultory manner. The
most celebrated of these artists, though born at different
epochs, have joined in a trial of skill in the Amazons which
they have respectively made. When these statues were dedicated
in the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, it was agreed, in
order to ascertain which was the best, that it should be left to
the judgment of the artists themselves who were then present:
upon which, it was evident that that was the best, which all
the artists agreed in considering as the next best to his own.
Accordingly, the first rank was assigned to Polycletus, the
second to Phidias, the third to Cresilas, the fourth to Cydon,
and the fifth to Phradmon.<a id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>Phidias, besides the Olympian Jupiter, which no one has
ever equalled, also executed in ivory the erect statue of
Minerva, which is in the Parthenon at Athens.<a id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a> He also
made in brass, beside the Amazon above mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a> a Minerva,
of such exquisite beauty, that it received its name from its fine
proportions.<a id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a> He also made the Cliduchus,<a id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a> and another
Minerva, which Paulus √Ümilius dedicated at Rome in the
Temple of Fortune<a id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a> of the passing day. Also the two statues,
draped with the pallium, which Catulus erected in the same
temple; and a nude colossal statue. Phidias is deservedly
considered to have discovered and developed the toreutic art.<a id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a></p>

<p>Polycletus of Sicyon,<a id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">1398</a> the pupil of Agelades, executed
the Diadumenos,<a id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">1399</a> the statue of an effeminate youth, and
remarkable for having cost one hundred talents; as also
the statue of a youth full of manly vigour, and called the
Doryphoros.<a id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">1400</a> He also made what the artists have called the
Model statue,<a id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">1401</a> and from which, as from a sort of standard,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>they study the lineaments: so that he, of all men, is thought in
one work of art to have exhausted all the resources of art.
He also made statues of a man using the body-scraper,<a id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">1402</a> and
of a naked man challenging to play at dice;<a id="FNanchor_1403_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">1403</a> as also of two
naked boys playing at dice, and known as the Astragalizontes;<a id="FNanchor_1404_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">1404</a>
they are now in the atrium of the Emperor Titus, and it is generally
considered, that there can be no work more perfect than
this. He also executed a Mercury, which was formerly at Lysimachia;
a Hercules Ageter,<a id="FNanchor_1405_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">1405</a> seizing his arms, which is now at
Rome; and an Artemon, which has received the name of
Periphoretos.<a id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">1406</a> Polycletus is generally considered as having
attained the highest excellence in statuary, and as having perfected
the toreutic<a id="FNanchor_1407_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">1407</a> art, which Phidias invented. A discovery
which was entirely his own, was the art of placing statues on
one leg. It is remarked, however, by Varro, that his statues
are all square-built,<a id="FNanchor_1408_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">1408</a> and made very much after the same
model.<a id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">1409</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>Myron of Eleuther√¶,<a id="FNanchor_1410_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">1410</a> who was also the pupil of Agelades,
was rendered more particularly famous by his statue of a
heifer,<a id="FNanchor_1411_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411_1411" class="fnanchor">1411</a> celebrated in many well-known lines: so true is it,
that most men owe their renown more to the genius of others,
than to their own. He also made the figure of a dog,<a id="FNanchor_1412_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">1412</a> a
Discobolus,<a id="FNanchor_1413_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">1413</a> a Perseus,<a id="FNanchor_1414_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">1414</a> the Prist√¶,<a id="FNanchor_1415_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">1415</a> a Satyr<a id="FNanchor_1416_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">1416</a> admiring a flute,
and a Minerva, the Delphic Pentathletes,<a id="FNanchor_1417_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417_1417" class="fnanchor">1417</a> the Pancratiast√¶,<a id="FNanchor_1418_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">1418</a>
and a Hercules,<a id="FNanchor_1419_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">1419</a> which is at the Circus Maximus, in the house
of Pompeius Magnus. Erinna,<a id="FNanchor_1420_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">1420</a> in her poems,<a id="FNanchor_1421_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a> makes allusion
to a monument which he erected to a cricket and a locust.
He also executed the Apollo, which, after being taken from the
Ephesians by the Triumvir Antonius, was restored by the
Emperor Augustus, he having been admonished to do so in a
dream. Myron appears to have been the first to give a varied
development to the art,<a id="FNanchor_1422_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a> having made a greater number of
designs than Polycletus, and shewn more attention to symmetry.
And yet, though he was very accurate in the proportions
of his figures, he has neglected to give expression;
besides which, he has not treated the hair and the pubes with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>any greater attention than is observed in the rude figures of
more ancient times.</p>

<p>Pythagoras of Rhegium, in Italy, excelled him in the figure
of the Pancratiast<a id="FNanchor_1423_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a> which is now at Delphi, and in which he
also surpassed Leontiscus.<a id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a> Pythagoras also executed the statue
of Astylos,<a id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a> the runner, which is exhibited at Olympia; that
of a Libyan boy holding a tablet, also in the same place; and
a nude male figure holding fruit. There is at Syracuse a
figure of a lame man by him: persons, when looking at it,
seem to feel the very pain of his wound. He also made an
Apollo, with the serpent<a id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">1426</a> pierced by his arrows; and a Player
on the Lyre, known as the Dic√¶us,<a id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a> from the fact that, when
Thebes was taken by Alexander the Great, a fugitive successfully
concealed in its bosom a sum of gold. He was the first artist
who gave expression to the sinews and the veins, and paid
more attention to the hair.</p>

<p>There was also another Pythagoras, a Samian,<a id="FNanchor_1428_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">1428</a> who was
originally a painter, seven of whose nude figures, in the
Temple of Fortune of the passing day,<a id="FNanchor_1429_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">1429</a> and one of an aged
man, are very much admired. He is said to have resembled
the last-mentioned artist so much in his features, that they
could not be distinguished. Sostratus, it is said, was the
pupil of Pythagoras of Rhegium, and his sister‚Äôs son.</p>

<p>According to Duris,<a id="FNanchor_1430_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">1430</a> Lysippus the Sicyonian was not the
pupil<a id="FNanchor_1431_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">1431</a> of any one, but was originally a worker in brass, and
was first prompted to venture upon statuary by an answer that
was given by Eupompus the painter; who, upon being asked
which of his predecessors he proposed to take for his model,
pointed to a crowd of men, and replied that it was Nature herself,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>and no artist, that he proposed to imitate. As already mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_1432_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">1432</a>
Lysippus was most prolific in his works, and made more
statues than any other artist. Among these, is the Man using the
Body-scraper<a id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a>, which Marcus Agrippa had erected in front of his
Warm Baths,<a id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a> and which wonderfully pleased the Emperor
Tiberius. This prince, although in the beginning of his reign
he imposed some restraint upon himself, could not resist the
temptation, and had this statue removed to his bed-chamber,
having substituted another for it at the baths: the people,
however, were so resolutely opposed to this, that at the theatre
they clamourously demanded the Apoxyomenos<a id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">1435</a> to be replaced;
and the prince, notwithstanding his attachment to it, was
obliged to restore it.</p>

<p>Lysippus is also celebrated for his statue of the intoxicated
Female Flute-player, his dogs and huntsmen, and, more particularly,
for his Chariot with the Sun, as represented by the
Rhodians.<a id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a> He also executed a numerous series of statues of
Alexander the Great, commencing from his childhood.<a id="FNanchor_1437_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a> The
Emperor Nero was so delighted with his statue of the infant
Alexander, that he had it gilt: this addition, however, to its
value, so detracted from its artistic beauty that the gold was
removed, and in this state it was looked upon as still more
precious, though disfigured by the scratches and seams which
remained upon it, and in which the gold was still to be seen.<a id="FNanchor_1438_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a>
He also made the statue of Heph√¶stion, the friend of Alexander
the Great, which some persons attribute to Polycletus,
whereas that artist lived nearly a century before his time.<a id="FNanchor_1439_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a>
Also, the statue of Alexander at the chase, now consecrated at
Delphi, the figure of a Satyr, now at Athens, and the Squadron
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>of Alexander,<a id="FNanchor_1440_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a> all of whom he represented with the greatest
accuracy. This last work of art, after his conquest of Macedonia,<a id="FNanchor_1441_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">1441</a>
Metellus conveyed to Rome. Lysippus also executed
chariots of various kinds. He is considered to have contributed
very greatly to the art of statuary by expressing the
details of the hair,<a id="FNanchor_1442_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">1442</a> and by making the head smaller than had
been done by the ancients, and the body more graceful and less
bulky, a method by which his statues were made to appear
taller. The Latin language has no appropriate name for that
‚Äúsymmetry,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1443_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a> which he so attentively observed in his new and
hitherto untried method of modifying the squareness observable
in the ancient statues. Indeed, it was a common saying
of his, that other artists made men as they actually were, while
he made them as they appeared to be. One peculiar characteristic
of his work, is the finish and minuteness which are observed
in even the smallest details. Lysippus left three sons,
who were also his pupils, and became celebrated as artists,
Laippus, B≈ìdas, and, more particularly, Euthycrates; though
this last-named artist rivalled his father in precision rather
than in elegance, and preferred scrupulous correctness to gracefulness.
Nothing can be more expressive than his Hercules
at Delphi, his Alexander, his Hunter at Thespi√¶, and his
Equestrian Combat. Equally good, too, are his statue of Trophonius,
erected in the oracular cave<a id="FNanchor_1444_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a> of that divinity, his
numerous chariots, his Horse with the Panniers,<a id="FNanchor_1445_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a> and his hounds.</p>

<p>Tisicrates, also a native of Sicyon, was a pupil of Euthycrates,
but more nearly approaching the style of Lysippus; so
much so, that several of his statues can scarcely be distinguished
from those of Lysippus; his aged Theban, for example, his King
Demetrius, and his Peucestes, who saved the life of Alexander
the Great, and so rendered himself deserving of this honour.<a id="FNanchor_1446_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p>Artists, who have transmitted these details in their works,
bestow wonderful encomiums upon Telephanes, the Phoc√¶an,
a statuary but little known, they say, because he lived in Thessaly,
where his works remained concealed; according to their
account, however, he is quite equal to Polycletus, Myron, and
Pythagoras. They more particularly commend his Larissa,
his Spintharus, the pentathlete,<a id="FNanchor_1447_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a> and his Apollo. Others,
however, assign another reason for his being so little known;
it being owing, they think, to his having devoted himself to
the studios established by Kings Xerxes and Darius.</p>

<p>Praxiteles, who excelled more particularly in marble, and
thence acquired his chief celebrity, also executed some very
beautiful works in brass, the Rape of Proserpine, the Catagusa,<a id="FNanchor_1448_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a>
a Father Liber,<a id="FNanchor_1449_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">1449</a> a figure of Drunkenness, and the celebrated
Satyr,<a id="FNanchor_1450_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">1450</a> to the Greeks known as ‚ÄúPeriboetos.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1451_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">1451</a> He also executed
the statues, which were formerly before the Temple<a id="FNanchor_1452_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">1452</a> of Good
Fortune, and the Venus, which was destroyed by fire, with
the Temple of that goddess, in the reign of Claudius, and was
considered equal to his marble statue of Venus,<a id="FNanchor_1453_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">1453</a> so celebrated
throughout the world. He also executed a Stephanusa,<a id="FNanchor_1454_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">1454</a> a Spilumene,<a id="FNanchor_1455_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">1455</a>
an ≈ínophorus,<a id="FNanchor_1456_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">1456</a> and two figures of Harmodius and
Aristogiton, who slew the tyrants; which last, having been taken
away from Greece by Xerxes, were restored to the Athenians on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>the conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great.<a id="FNanchor_1457_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">1457</a> He also made
the youthful Apollo, known as the ‚ÄúSauroctonos,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1458_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">1458</a> because he
is aiming an arrow at a lizard which is stealing towards him.
There are greatly admired, also, two statues of his, expressive
of contrary emotions‚Äîa Matron in tears, and a Courtesan full
of gaiety: this last is supposed to be a likeness of Phryne, and
it is said that we can detect in her figure the love of the artist,
and in the countenance of the courtesan the promised reward.<a id="FNanchor_1459_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">1459</a></p>

<p>His kindness of heart, too, is witnessed by another figure;
for in a chariot and horses which had been executed by Calamis,<a id="FNanchor_1460_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">1460</a>
he himself made the charioteer, in order that the artist,
who excelled in the representation of horses, might not be
considered deficient in the human figure. This last-mentioned
artist has executed other chariots also, some with four
horses, and some with two; and in his horses he is always
unrivalled. But that it may not be supposed that he was so
greatly inferior in his human figures, it is as well to remark
that his Alcmena<a id="FNanchor_1461_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">1461</a> is equal to any that was ever produced.</p>

<p>Alcamenes,<a id="FNanchor_1462_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">1462</a> who was a pupil of Phidias, worked in marble
and executed a Pentathlete in brass, known as the ‚ÄúEncrinomenos.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1463_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">1463</a>
Aristides, too, who was the scholar of Polycletus,
executed chariots in metal with four and two horses. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>Le√¶na<a id="FNanchor_1464_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a> of Amphicrates<a id="FNanchor_1465_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">1465</a> is highly commended. The courtesan<a id="FNanchor_1466_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a>
Le√¶na, who was a skilful performer on the lyre, and
had so become acquainted with Harmodius and Aristogiton,
submitted to be tortured till she expired, rather than betray
their plot for the extermination of the tyrants.<a id="FNanchor_1467_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">1467</a> The Athenians,
being desirous of honouring her memory, without at
the same time rendering homage to a courtesan, had her represented
under the figure of the animal whose name she bore;<a id="FNanchor_1468_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">1468</a>
and, in order to indicate the cause of the honour thus paid her,
ordered the artist to represent the animal without a tongue.<a id="FNanchor_1469_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">1469</a></p>

<p>Bryaxis executed in brass statues of √Üsculapius and Seleucus;<a id="FNanchor_1470_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a>
B≈ìdas<a id="FNanchor_1471_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a> a figure in adoration; Baton, an Apollo and a
Juno, which are in the Temple of Concord<a id="FNanchor_1472_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a> at Rome.</p>

<p>Ctesila√ºs<a id="FNanchor_1473_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a> executed a statue of a man fainting from his
wounds, in the expression of which may be seen how little
life remains;<a id="FNanchor_1474_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a> as also the Olympian Pericles,<a id="FNanchor_1475_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a> well worthy of
its title: indeed, it is one of the marvellous adjuncts of this
art, that it renders men who are already celebrated even more
so.</p>

<p>Cephisodotus<a id="FNanchor_1476_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a> is the artist of an admirable Minerva, now
erected in the port of Athens; as also of the altar before the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>Temple of Jupiter Servator,<a id="FNanchor_1477_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a> at the same place, to which,
indeed, few works are comparable.</p>

<p>Canachus<a id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a> executed a nude Apollo, which is known as the
‚ÄúPhilesian:‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a> it is at Didymi,<a id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">1480</a> and is composed of bronze
that was fused at √Ügina. He also made a stag with it, so
nicely poised on its hoofs, as to admit of a thread being passed
beneath. One<a id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">1481</a> fore-foot, too, and the alternate hind-foot are
so made as firmly to grip the base, the socket being<a id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a> so indented
on either side, as to admit of the figure being thrown
at pleasure upon alternate feet. Another work of his was the
boys known as the ‚ÄúCeletizontes.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a></p>

<p>Ch√¶reas made statues of Alexander the Great and of his
father Philip. Desila√ºs<a id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a> made a Doryphoros<a id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a> and a wounded
Amazon; and Demetrius<a id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">1486</a> a statue of Lysimache, who was
priestess of Minerva sixty-four years. This statuary also made
the Minerva, which has the name of Musica,<a id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a> and so called because
the dragons on its Gorgon‚Äôs head vibrate at the sound of
the lyre; also an equestrian statue of Simon, the first writer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>on the art of equitation.<a id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a> D√¶dalus,<a id="FNanchor_1489_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a> who is highly esteemed
as a modeller in clay, made two brazen figures of youths using
the body-scraper;<a id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a> and Dinomenes executed figures of Protesila√ºs<a id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">1491</a>
and Pythodemus the wrestler.</p>

<p>The statue of Alexander Paris is the work of Euphranor:<a id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">1492</a> it
is much admired, because we recognize in it, at the same moment,
all these characteristics; we see him as the umpire between
the goddesses, the paramour of Helen, and yet the slayer
of Achilles. We have a Minerva, too, by Euphranor, at Rome,
known as the ‚ÄúCatulina,‚Äù and dedicated below the Capitol, by Q.
Lutatius;<a id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a> also a figure of Good Success,<a id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a> holding in the right
hand a patera, and in the left an ear of corn and a poppy.
There is also a Latona by him, in the Temple of Concord,<a id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a>
with the new-born infants Apollo and Diana in her arms. He
also executed some brazen chariots with four and two horses,
and a Cliduchus<a id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a> of beautiful proportions; as also two colossal
statues, one representing Virtue, the other Greece;<a id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a> and a
figure of a female lost in wonder and adoration: with statues of
Alexander and Philip in chariots with four horses. Eutychides
executed an emblematic figure of the Eurotas,<a id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a> of which it has
been frequently remarked, that the work of the artist appears
more flowing than the waters even of the river.<a id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">1499</a></p>

<p>Hegias<a id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">1500</a> is celebrated for his Minerva and his King Pyrrhus,
his youthful Celetizontes,<a id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">1501</a> and his statues of Castor and Pollux,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>before the Temple of Jupiter Tonans:<a id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">1502</a> Hegesias,<a id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">1503</a> for his
Hercules, which is at our colony of Parium.<a id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a> Of Isidotus we
have the Buthytes.<a id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">1505</a></p>

<p>Lycius was the pupil<a id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">1506</a> of Myron: he made a figure representing
a boy blowing a nearly extinguished fire, well worthy
of his master, as also figures of the Argonauts. Leochares
made a bronze representing the eagle carrying off Ganymede:
the eagle has all the appearance of being sensible of the importance
of his burden, and for whom he is carrying it, being
careful not to injure the youth with his talons, even through
the garments.<a id="FNanchor_1507_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">1507</a> He executed a figure, also, of Autolycus,<a id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">1508</a> who
had been victorious in the contests of the Pancratium, and for
whom Xenophon wrote his Symposium;<a id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">1509</a> the figure, also, of
Jupiter Tonans in the Capitol, the most admired of all his
works; and a statue of Apollo crowned with a diadem. He
executed, also, a figure of Lyciscus, and one of the boy Lagon,<a id="FNanchor_1510_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">1510</a>
full of the archness and low-bred cunning of the slave. Lycius
also made a figure of a boy burning perfumes.</p>

<p>We have a young bull by Men√¶chmus,<a id="FNanchor_1511_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">1511</a> pressed down beneath
a man‚Äôs knee, with its neck bent back:<a id="FNanchor_1512_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">1512</a> this Men√¶chmus
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>has also written a treatise on his art. Naucydes<a id="FNanchor_1513_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">1513</a> is
admired for a Mercury, a Discobolus,<a id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">1514</a> and a Man sacrificing a
Ram. Naucerus made a figure of a wrestler panting for
breath; Niceratus, an √Üsculapius and Hygeia,<a id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a> which are
in the Temple of Concord at Rome. Pyromachus represented
Alcibiades, managing a chariot with four horses: Polycles
made a splendid statue of Hermaphroditus; Pyrrhus, statues of
Hygeia and Minerva; and Phanis, who was a pupil of Lysippus,
an Epithyusa.<a id="FNanchor_1516_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">1516</a></p>

<p>Stypax of Cyprus acquired his celebrity by a single work,
the statue of the Splanchnoptes;<a id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a> which represents a slave of
the Olympian Pericles, roasting entrails and kindling the fire
with his breath. Silanion made a statue in metal of Apollodorus,
who was himself a modeller, and not only the most
diligent of all in the study of this art, but a most severe
criticizer of his own works, frequently breaking his statues to
pieces when he had finished them, and never able to satisfy
his intense passion for the art‚Äîa circumstance which procured
him the surname of ‚Äúthe Madman.‚Äù Indeed, it is this expression
which he has given to his works, which represent in
metal embodied anger rather than the lineaments of a human
being. The Achilles, also, of Silanion is very excellent, and
his Epistates<a id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a> exercising the Athletes. Strongylion<a id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">1519</a> made a
figure of an Amazon, which, from the beauty of the legs, was
known as the ‚ÄúEucnemos,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a> and which Nero used to have carried
about with him in his travels. Strongylion was the artist,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>also, of a youthful figure, which was so much admired by
Brutus of Philippi, that it received from him its surname.<a id="FNanchor_1521_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a></p>

<p>Theodorus of Samos,<a id="FNanchor_1522_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">1522</a> who constructed the Labyrinth,<a id="FNanchor_1523_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a> cast
his own statue in brass; which was greatly admired, not only
for its resemblance, but for the extreme delicacy of the work.
In the right hand he holds a file, and with three fingers of the
left, a little model of a four-horse chariot, which has since
been transferred to Pr√¶neste:<a id="FNanchor_1524_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">1524</a> it is so extremely minute, that
the whole piece, both chariot and charioteer, may be covered
by the wings of a fly, which he also made with it.</p>

<p>Xenocrates<a id="FNanchor_1525_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a> was the pupil of Ticrates, or, as some say, of
Euthycrates: he surpassed them both, however, in the number
of his statues, and was the author of some treatises on his art.</p>

<p>Several artists have represented the battles fought by Attalus
and Eumenes with the Galli;<a id="FNanchor_1526_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a> Isigonus, for instance, Pyromachus,
Stratonicus, and Antigonus,<a id="FNanchor_1527_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">1527</a> who also wrote some
works in reference to his art. Bo√´thus,<a id="FNanchor_1528_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">1528</a> although more celebrated
for his works in silver, has executed a beautiful figure
of a child strangling a goose. The most celebrated of all the
works, of which I have here spoken, have been dedicated, for
some time past, by the Emperor Vespasianus in the Temple of
Peace,<a id="FNanchor_1529_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a> and other public buildings of his. They had before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>been forcibly carried off by Nero,<a id="FNanchor_1530_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a> and brought to Rome,
and arranged by him in the reception-rooms of his Golden
Palace.<a id="FNanchor_1531_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a></p>

<p>In addition to these, there are several other artists, of about
equal celebrity, but none of whom have produced any first-rate
works; Ariston,<a id="FNanchor_1532_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a> who was principally employed in chasing
silver, Callides, Ctesias, Cantharus of Sicyon,<a id="FNanchor_1533_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a> Diodorus, a
pupil of Critias, Deliades, Euphorion, Eunicus,<a id="FNanchor_1534_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a> and Hecat√¶us,<a id="FNanchor_1535_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a>
all of them chasers in silver; Lesbocles, also, Prodorus, Pythodicus,
and Polygnotus,<a id="FNanchor_1536_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a> one of the most celebrated painters;
also two other chasers in silver, Stratonicus,<a id="FNanchor_1537_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a> and Scymnus, a
pupil of Critias.</p>

<p>I shall now enumerate those artists who have executed
works of the same class:‚Äî Apollodorus,<a id="FNanchor_1538_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a> for example, Antrobulus,
Asclepiodorus, and Aleuas, who have executed statues
of philosophers. Apellas<a id="FNanchor_1539_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a> has left us some figures of females
in the act of adoration; Antignotus, a Perixyomenos,<a id="FNanchor_1540_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a> and
figures of the Tyrannicides, already mentioned. Antimachus
and Athenodorus made some statues of females of noble birth;
Aristodemus<a id="FNanchor_1541_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a> executed figures of wrestlers, two-horse chariots
with the charioteers, philosophers, aged women, and a statue
of King Seleucus:<a id="FNanchor_1542_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a> his Doryphoros,<a id="FNanchor_1543_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a> too, possesses his characteristic
gracefulness.</p>

<p>There were two artists of the name of Cephisodotus:<a id="FNanchor_1544_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a> the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>earlier of them made a figure of Mercury nursing Father Liber<a id="FNanchor_1545_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a>
when an infant; also of a man haranguing, with the hand
elevated, the original of which is now unknown. The younger
Cephisodotus executed statues of philosophers. Colotes,<a id="FNanchor_1546_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a> who
assisted Phidias in the Olympian Jupiter, also executed statues
of philosophers; the same, too, with Cleon,<a id="FNanchor_1547_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">1547</a> Cenchramis,
Callicles,<a id="FNanchor_1548_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">1548</a> and Cepis. Chalcosthenes made statues of comedians
and athletes. Da√Øppus<a id="FNanchor_1549_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">1549</a> executed a Perixyomenos.<a id="FNanchor_1550_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a>
Da√Øphron, Democritus,<a id="FNanchor_1551_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a> and D√¶mon made statues of philosophers.</p>

<p>Epigonus, who has attempted nearly all the above-named
classes of works, has distinguished himself more particularly
by his Trumpeter, and his Child in Tears, caressing its murdered
mother. The Woman in Admiration, of Eubulus, is
highly praised; and so is the Man, by Eubulides,<a id="FNanchor_1552_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">1552</a> reckoning
on his Fingers. Micon<a id="FNanchor_1553_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_1553_1553" class="fnanchor">1553</a> is admired for his athletes; Menogenes,
for his four-horse chariots. Niceratus,<a id="FNanchor_1554_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a> too, who
attempted every kind of work that had been executed by any
other artist, made statues of Alcibiades and of his mother
Demarate,<a id="FNanchor_1555_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">1555</a> who is represented sacrificing by the light of
torches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>Tisicrates<a id="FNanchor_1556_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a> executed a two-horse chariot in brass, in which
Piston afterwards placed the figure of a female. Piston also
made the statues of Mars and Mercury, which are in the
Temple of Concord at Rome. No one can commend Perillus;<a id="FNanchor_1557_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a>
more cruel even than the tyrant Phalaris<a id="FNanchor_1558_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a> himself, he made
for him a brazen bull, asserting that when a man was enclosed
in it, and fire applied beneath, the cries of the man would
resemble the roaring of a bull: however, with a cruelty in
this instance marked by justice, the experiment of this torture
was first tried upon himself. To such a degree did this man
degrade the art of representing gods and men, an art more
adapted than any other to refine the feelings! Surely so many
persons had not toiled to perfect it in order to make it an instrument
of torture! Hence it is that the works of Perillus are
only preserved, in order that whoever sees them, may detest
the hands that made them.</p>

<p>Sthennis<a id="FNanchor_1559_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a> made the statues of Ceres, Jupiter, and Minerva,
which are now in the Temple of Concord; also figures of matrons
weeping, adoring, and offering sacrifice; Simon<a id="FNanchor_1560_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a> executed
figures of a dog and an archer. Stratonicus,<a id="FNanchor_1561_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a> the chaser
in silver, made some figures of philosophers; and so did both
of the artists named Scopas.<a id="FNanchor_1562_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a></p>

<p>The following artists have made statues of athletes, armed
men, hunters, and sacrifices‚ÄîBaton,<a id="FNanchor_1563_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a> Euchir,<a id="FNanchor_1564_1564"></a><a href="#Footnote_1564_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a> Glaucides,<a id="FNanchor_1565_1565"></a><a href="#Footnote_1565_1565" class="fnanchor">1565</a>

famous painter, whom we shall have occasion to mention hereafter;<a id="FNanchor_1571_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1571_1571" class="fnanchor">1571</a>
Patrocles, Pollis, Posidonius<a id="FNanchor_1572_1572"></a><a href="#Footnote_1572_1572" class="fnanchor">1572</a> the Ephesian, who was
also a celebrated chaser in silver; Periclymenus,<a id="FNanchor_1573_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1573_1573" class="fnanchor">1573</a> Philon,<a id="FNanchor_1574_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1574_1574" class="fnanchor">1574</a>
Symenus, Timotheus,<a id="FNanchor_1575_1575"></a><a href="#Footnote_1575_1575" class="fnanchor">1575</a> Theomnestus,<a id="FNanchor_1576_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1576_1576" class="fnanchor">1576</a> Timarchides,<a id="FNanchor_1577_1577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1577_1577" class="fnanchor">1577</a> Timon,
Tisias, and Thrason.<a id="FNanchor_1578_1578"></a><a href="#Footnote_1578_1578" class="fnanchor">1578</a></p>

<p>But of all these, Callimachus is the most remarkable, on
account of his surname. Being always dissatisfied with himself,
and continually correcting his works, he obtained the name
of ‚ÄúCatatexitechnos;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1579_1579"></a><a href="#Footnote_1579_1579" class="fnanchor">1579</a> thus affording a memorable example
of the necessity of observing moderation even in carefulness.
His Laconian Female Dancers, for instance, is a most correct
performance, but one in which, by extreme correctness, he has
effaced all gracefulness. It has been said, too, that Callimachus
was a painter also. Cato, in his expedition against
Cyprus,<a id="FNanchor_1580_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">1580</a> sold all the statues that he found there, with the exception
of one of Zeno; in which case he was influenced, neither
by the value of the metal nor by its excellence as a work of
art, but by the fact that it was the statue of a philosopher. I
only mention this circumstance casually, that an example<a id="FNanchor_1581_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">1581</a>
so little followed, may be known.</p>

<p>While speaking of statues, there is one other that should
not be omitted, although its author is unknown, that of Hercules
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>clothed in a tunic,<a id="FNanchor_1582_1582"></a><a href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">1582</a> the only one represented in that
costume in Rome: it stands near the Rostra, and the countenance
is stern and expressive of his last agonies, caused by
that dress. There are three inscriptions on it; the first of
which states that it had formed part of the spoil obtained by
L. Lucullus<a id="FNanchor_1583_1583"></a><a href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">1583</a> the general; the second, that his son, while still
a minor, dedicated in accordance with a decree of the Senate;
the third, that T. Septimius Sabinus, the curule √¶dile, had it
restored to the public from the hands of a private individual.
So vast has been the rivalry caused by this statue, and so high
the value set upon it.</p>

CHAP. 20.‚ÄîTHE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COPPER AND ITS COMBINATIONS.
PYROPUS. CAMPANIAN COPPER.</span></h3></div>

<p>We will now return to the different kinds of copper, and its
several combinations. In Cyprian copper we have the kind
known as ‚Äúcoronarium,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1584_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">1584</a> and that called ‚Äúregulare,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1585_1585"></a><a href="#Footnote_1585_1585" class="fnanchor">1585</a> both
of them ductile. The former is made into thin leaves, and,
after being coloured with ox-gall,<a id="FNanchor_1586_1586"></a><a href="#Footnote_1586_1586" class="fnanchor">1586</a> is used for what has all
the appearance of gilding on the coronets worn upon the stage.
The same substance, if mixed with gold, in the proportion of
six scruples of gold to the ounce, and reduced into thin plates,
acquires a fiery red colour, and is termed ‚Äúpyropus.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1587_1587"></a><a href="#Footnote_1587_1587" class="fnanchor">1587</a> In
other mines again, they prepare the kind known as ‚Äúregulare,‚Äù
as also that which is called ‚Äúcaldarium.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1588_1588"></a><a href="#Footnote_1588_1588" class="fnanchor">1588</a> These differ from
each other in this respect, that, in the latter, the metal is only
fused, and breaks when struck with the hammer, whereas the
‚Äúregulare‚Äù is malleable, or ductile,<a id="FNanchor_1589_1589"></a><a href="#Footnote_1589_1589" class="fnanchor">1589</a> as some call it, a property
which belongs naturally to all the copper of Cyprus. In the
case, however, of all the other mines, this difference between
bar copper and cast brass is produced by artificial means. All
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>the ores, in fact, will produce bar or malleable copper when
sufficiently melted and purified by heat. Among the other
kinds of copper, the palm of excellence is awarded to that of
Campania,<a id="FNanchor_1590_1590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1590_1590" class="fnanchor">1590</a> which is the most esteemed for vessels and utensils.
This last is prepared several ways. At Capua it is melted
upon fires made with wood, and not coals, after which it
is sprinkled with cold water and cleansed through a sieve
made of oak. After being thus smelted a number of times,
Spanish silver-lead is added to it, in the proportion of ten
pounds of lead to one hundred pounds of copper; a method
by which it is rendered pliable, and made to assume that agreeable
colour which is imparted to other kinds of copper by the
application of oil and the action of the sun. Many parts,
however, of Italy, and the provinces, produce a similar kind
of metal; but there they add only eight pounds of lead, and,
in consequence of the scarcity of wood, melt it several times
over upon coals. It is in Gaul more particularly, where the
ore is melted between red-hot stones, that the difference is to
be seen that is produced by these variations in the method of
smelting. Indeed, this last method scorches the metal, and
renders it black and friable. Besides, they only melt it twice;
whereas, the oftener this operation is repeated, the better in
quality it becomes.</p>

<p>(9.) It is also as well to remark that all copper fuses best
when the weather is intensely cold. The proper combination
for making statues and tablets is as follows: the ore is first
melted; after which there is added to the molten metal one
third part of second-hand<a id="FNanchor_1591_1591"></a><a href="#Footnote_1591_1591" class="fnanchor">1591</a> copper, or in other words, copper
that has been in use and bought up for the purpose. For it
is a peculiarity of this metal that when it has been some time
in use, and has been subject to long-continued friction, it becomes
seasoned, and subdued, as it were, to a high polish.
Twelve pounds and a half of silver-lead are then added to
every hundred pounds of the fused metal. There is also a
combination of copper, of a most delicate nature, ‚Äúmould-copper,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1592_1592"></a><a href="#Footnote_1592_1592" class="fnanchor">1592</a>
as it is called; there being added to the metal one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>tenth part of lead<a id="FNanchor_1593_1593"></a><a href="#Footnote_1593_1593" class="fnanchor">1593</a> and one twentieth of silver-lead, this
combination being the best adapted for taking the colour
known as ‚ÄúGr√¶c√¶nicus.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1594_1594"></a><a href="#Footnote_1594_1594" class="fnanchor">1594</a> The last kind is that known as
‚Äúollaria,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1595_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">1595</a> from the vessels that are made of it: in this
combination three or four pounds of silver-lead<a id="FNanchor_1596_1596"></a><a href="#Footnote_1596_1596" class="fnanchor">1596</a> are added to
every hundred pounds of copper. By the addition of lead to
Cyprian copper, the purple tint is produced that we see upon
the drapery of statues.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_21"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 21.‚ÄîTHE METHOD OF PRESERVING COPPER.</span></h3></div>

<p>Copper becomes covered with verdigris more quickly when
cleaned than when neglected, unless it is well rubbed with
oil. It is said that the best method of preserving it is
with a coating of tar. The custom of making use of copper
for monuments, which are intended to be perpetuated, is of
very ancient date: it is upon tablets of brass that our public
enactments are engraved.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_22"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 22. (10.)‚ÄîCADMIA.</span></h3></div>

<p>The ores of copper furnish a number of resources<a id="FNanchor_1597_1597"></a><a href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">1597</a> that are
employed in medicine; indeed, all kinds of ulcers are healed
thereby with great rapidity. Of these, however, the most
useful is cadmia.<a id="FNanchor_1598_1598"></a><a href="#Footnote_1598_1598" class="fnanchor">1598</a> This substance is formed artificially,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>beyond a doubt, in the furnaces, also, where they smelt silver,
but it is whiter and not so heavy, and by no means to be compared
with that from copper. There are several kinds of it. For,
as the mineral itself, from which it is prepared artificially, so
necessary in fusing copper ore, and so useful in medicine, has
the name of ‚Äúcadmia,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1599_1599"></a><a href="#Footnote_1599_1599" class="fnanchor">1599</a> so also is it found in the smelting-furnaces,
where it receives other names, according to the way in
which it is formed. By the action of the flame and the blast,
the more attenuated parts of the metal are separated, and
become attached, in proportion to their lightness, to the
arched top and sides of the furnace. These flakes are the
thinnest near the exterior opening of the furnace, where the
flame finds a vent, the substance being called ‚Äúcapnitis;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1600_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600_1600" class="fnanchor">1600</a>
from its burnt appearance and its extreme lightness it resembles
white ashes. The best is that which is found in the
interior, hanging from the arches of the chimney, and from its
form and position named ‚Äúbotryitis.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1601_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601_1601" class="fnanchor">1601</a> It is heavier than the
first-mentioned kind, but lighter than those which follow. It
is of two different colours: the least valuable is ash-coloured,
the better kind being red, friable, and extremely useful as a
remedy for affections of the eyes.</p>

<p>A third kind of cadmia is that found on the sides of the
furnace, and which, in consequence of its weight, could not
reach the arched vaults of the chimney. This species is
called ‚Äúplacitis,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1602_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602_1602" class="fnanchor">1602</a> in reference to its solid appearance, it presenting
a plane surface more like a solid crust than pumice,
and mottled within. Its great use is, for the cure of itch-scab,
and for making wounds cicatrize. Of this last there
are two varieties, the ‚Äúonychitis,‚Äù which is almost entirely
blue on the exterior, and spotted like an onyx within;
and the ‚Äúostracitis,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1603_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603_1603" class="fnanchor">1603</a> which is quite black and more dirty
than the others, but particularly useful for healing wounds.
All the species of cadmia are of the best quality from the
furnaces of Cyprus. When used in medicine it is heated a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>second time upon a fire of pure charcoal, and when duly
incinerated, is quenched in Aminean<a id="FNanchor_1604_1604"></a><a href="#Footnote_1604_1604" class="fnanchor">1604</a> wine, if required for
making plasters, but in vinegar, if wanted for the cure of itch-scab.
Some persons first pound it, and then burn it in
earthen pots; which done, they wash it in mortars and then
dry it.</p>

<p>Nymphodorus<a id="FNanchor_1605_1605"></a><a href="#Footnote_1605_1605" class="fnanchor">1605</a> recommends that the most heavy and dense
pieces of mineral cadmia that can be procured, should be
burnt upon hot coals and quenched in Chian wine; after
which, it must be pounded and then sifted through a linen
cloth. It is then pulverized in a mortar and macerated in
rain water, the sediment being again pounded until it is
reduced to the consistency of ceruse, and presents no grittiness
to the teeth. Iollas<a id="FNanchor_1606_1606"></a><a href="#Footnote_1606_1606" class="fnanchor">1606</a> recommends the same process;
except that he selects the purest specimens of native cadmia.</p>

MEDICINAL EFFECTS OF CALCINED COPPER.</span></h3></div>

<p>Cadmia<a id="FNanchor_1607_1607"></a><a href="#Footnote_1607_1607" class="fnanchor">1607</a> acts as a desiccative, heals wounds, arrests discharges,
acts detergently upon webs and foul incrustations of
the eyes, removes eruptions, and produces, in fact, all the good
effects which we shall have occasion to mention when speaking
of lead. Copper too, itself, when calcined, is employed for
all these purposes; in addition to which it is used for white
spots and cicatrizations upon the eyes. Mixed with milk, it
is curative also of ulcers upon the eyes; for which purpose,
the people in Egypt make a kind of eye-salve by grinding it
upon whet stones. Taken with honey, it acts as an emetic.
For these purposes, Cyprian copper is calcined in unbaked
earthen pots, with an equal quantity of sulphur; the apertures
of the vessel being well luted, and it being left in the furnace
until the vessel itself has become completely hardened. Some
persons add salt, and others substitute alum<a id="FNanchor_1608_1608"></a><a href="#Footnote_1608_1608" class="fnanchor">1608</a> for sulphur;
others, again, add nothing, but merely sprinkle the copper with
vinegar. When calcined, it is pounded in a mortar of Thebaic
stone,<a id="FNanchor_1609_1609"></a><a href="#Footnote_1609_1609" class="fnanchor">1609</a> after which it is washed with rain water, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>pounded with a large quantity of water, and left to settle.
This process is repeated until the deposit has gained the
appearance of minium;<a id="FNanchor_1610_1610"></a><a href="#Footnote_1610_1610" class="fnanchor">1610</a> after which it is dried in the sun, and
put by for keeping in a box made of copper.</p>

<p>The scoria, too, of copper is washed in the same manner; but
the action of it is less efficacious than that of copper itself.
The flower, too, of copper<a id="FNanchor_1611_1611"></a><a href="#Footnote_1611_1611" class="fnanchor">1611</a> is also used in medicine; a substance
which is procured by fusing copper, and then removing it into
another furnace, where the repeated action of the bellows
makes the metal separate into small scales, like the husks of
millet, and known as ‚Äúflower of copper.‚Äù These scales are
also separated, when the cakes of metal are plunged into
water: they become red, too, like the scales of copper known
as ‚Äúlepis,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1612_1612"></a><a href="#Footnote_1612_1612" class="fnanchor">1612</a> by means of which the genuine flower of copper
is adulterated, it being also sold under that name. This last is
made by hammering nails that are forged from the cakes of
metal. All these processes are principally carried on in the
furnaces of Cyprus; the great difference between these substances
being, that this lepis is detached from the cakes by
hammering, whereas the flower falls off spontaneously.</p>

as ‚Äústomoma.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1613_1613"></a><a href="#Footnote_1613_1613" class="fnanchor">1613</a> But of all these substances, and even of
their names, the physicians, if I may venture so to say, are
quite ignorant, as appears by the names they give them; so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>unacquainted are they with the preparation of medicaments,
a thing that was formerly considered the most essential part
of their profession.<a id="FNanchor_1614_1614"></a><a href="#Footnote_1614_1614" class="fnanchor">1614</a> At the present day, whenever they
happen to find a book of recipes, if they wish to make any
composition from these substances, or, in other words, to make
trial of the prescription at the expense of their unhappy
patients, they trust entirely to the druggists,<a id="FNanchor_1615_1615"></a><a href="#Footnote_1615_1615" class="fnanchor">1615</a> who spoil
everything by their fraudulent adulterations. For this long
time past, they have even purchased their plasters and eye-salves
ready made, and the consequence is, that the spoiled or
adulterated wares in the druggists‚Äô shops are thus got rid of.</p>

<p>Both lepis and flower of copper are calcined in shallow
earthen or brazen pans; after which they are washed, as
described above,<a id="FNanchor_1616_1616"></a><a href="#Footnote_1616_1616" class="fnanchor">1616</a> and employed for the same purposes; in addition
to which, they are used for excrescences in the nostrils and
in the anus, as also for dullness of the hearing, being forcibly
blown into the ears through a tube. Incorporated with meal,
they are applied to swellings of the uvula, and, with honey, to
swellings of the tonsils. The scales prepared from white
copper are much less efficacious than those from Cyprian
copper. Sometimes they first macerate the nails and cakes of
copper in a boy‚Äôs urine; and in some instances, they pound
the scales, when detached, and wash them in rain water.
They are then given to dropsical patients, in doses of two
drachm√¶, with one semisextarius of honied wine: they are also
made into a liniment with fine flour.</p>

<p>Verdigris<a id="FNanchor_1617_1617"></a><a href="#Footnote_1617_1617" class="fnanchor">1617</a> is also applied to many purposes, and is prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>in numerous ways. Sometimes it is detached already formed,
from the mineral from which copper is smelted: and sometimes
it is made by piercing holes in white copper, and suspending
it over strong vinegar in casks, which are closed with
covers; it being much superior if scales of copper are used for
the purpose. Some persons plunge vessels themselves, made
of white copper, into earthen pots filled with vinegar, and
scrape them at the end of ten days. Others, again, cover the
vessels with husks of grapes,<a id="FNanchor_1618_1618"></a><a href="#Footnote_1618_1618" class="fnanchor">1618</a> and scrape them in the same
way, at the end of ten days. Others sprinkle vinegar upon
copper filings, and stir them frequently with a spatula in the
course of the day, until they are completely dissolved. Others
prefer triturating these filings with vinegar in a brazen
mortar: but the most expeditious method of all is to add to
the vinegar shavings of coronet copper.<a id="FNanchor_1619_1619"></a><a href="#Footnote_1619_1619" class="fnanchor">1619</a> Rhodian verdigris,
more particularly, is adulterated with pounded marble; some
persons use pumice-stone or gum.</p>

<p>The adulteration, however, which is the most difficult to
detect, is made with copperas;<a id="FNanchor_1620_1620"></a><a href="#Footnote_1620_1620" class="fnanchor">1620</a> the other sophistications
being detected by the crackling of the substance when bitten
with the teeth. The best mode of testing it is by using an
iron fire-shovel; for when thus subjected to the fire, if pure,
the verdigris retains its colour, but if mixed with copperas, it
becomes red. The fraud may also be detected by using a leaf
of papyrus, which has been steeped in an infusion of nut-galls;
for it becomes black immediately upon the genuine verdigris
being applied. It may also be detected by the eye; the green
colour being unpleasant to the sight. But whether it is pure
or adulterated, the best method is first to wash and dry it, and
then to burn it in a new earthen vessel, turning it over until
it is reduced to an ash;<a id="FNanchor_1621_1621"></a><a href="#Footnote_1621_1621" class="fnanchor">1621</a> after which it is pounded and put by
for use. Some persons calcine it in raw earthen vessels, until
the earthenware becomes thoroughly baked: others again add
to it male frankincense.<a id="FNanchor_1622_1622"></a><a href="#Footnote_1622_1622" class="fnanchor">1622</a> Verdigris is washed, too, in the same
manner as cadmia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>It affords a most useful ingredient for eye-salves, and from
its mordent action is highly beneficial for watery humours of
the eyes. It is necessary, however, to wash the part with
warm water, applied with a fine sponge, until its mordency
is no longer felt.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHieracium‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1623_1623"></a><a href="#Footnote_1623_1623" class="fnanchor">1623</a> is the name given to an eye-salve, which is
essentially composed of the following ingredients; four ounces
of sal ammoniac, two of Cyprian verdigris, the same quantity
of the kind of copperas which is called ‚Äúchalcanthum,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1624_1624"></a><a href="#Footnote_1624_1624" class="fnanchor">1624</a> one

pounded together with Thasian vinegar and made up into
pills. It is an excellent remedy for incipient glaucoma and
cataract, as also for films upon the eyes, eruptions, albugo,
and diseases of the eye-lids. Verdigris, in a crude state, is
also used as an ingredient in plasters for wounds. In combination
with oil, it is wonderfully efficacious for ulcerations
of the mouth and gums, and for sore lips. Used in the form
of a cerate, it acts detergently upon ulcers, and promotes their
cicatrization. Verdigris also consumes the callosities of fistulas
and excrescences about the anus, either used by itself,
applied with sal ammoniac, or inserted in the fistula in the
form of a salve. The same substance, kneaded with one third
part of resin of turpentine, removes leprosy.</p>

‚Äúscolex.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1626_1626"></a><a href="#Footnote_1626_1626" class="fnanchor">1626</a> It is prepared by triturating in a mortar of

with the very strongest white vinegar. This preparation is
only made during the hottest days of the year, about the
rising of the Dog-star. The whole is triturated until it becomes
green, and assumes the appearance of small worms, to
which it owes its name. This repulsive form is corrected by
mixing the urine of a young child, with twice the quantity of
vinegar. Scolex is used for the same medicinal purposes as
santerna, which we have described as being used for soldering
gold,<a id="FNanchor_1627_1627"></a><a href="#Footnote_1627_1627" class="fnanchor">1627</a> and they have, both of them, the same properties as

CHAP. 29.‚ÄîCHALCITIS: SEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Chalcitis<a id="FNanchor_1628_1628"></a><a href="#Footnote_1628_1628" class="fnanchor">1628</a> is the name of a mineral, from which, as well as
cadmia, copper is extracted by heat. It differs from cadmia
in this respect, that this last is procured from beds below the
surface, while chalcitis is detached from rocks that are exposed
to the air. Chalcitis also becomes immediately friable, being
naturally so soft as to have the appearance of a compressed
mass of down. There is also this other distinction between
them, that chalcitis is a composition of three other substances,
copper, misy, and sory,<a id="FNanchor_1629_1629"></a><a href="#Footnote_1629_1629" class="fnanchor">1629</a> of which last we shall speak in their
appropriate places.<a id="FNanchor_1630_1630"></a><a href="#Footnote_1630_1630" class="fnanchor">1630</a> The veins of copper which it contains are
oblong. The most approved kind is of the colour of honey;
it is streaked with fine sinuous veins, and is friable and not
stony. It is generally thought to be most valuable when fresh,
as, when old, it becomes converted into sory. It is highly
useful for removing fleshy excrescences in ulcers, for arresting
h√¶morrhage, and, in the form of a powder, for acting astringently
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>upon the gums, the uvula, and the tonsillary glands.<a id="FNanchor_1631_1631"></a><a href="#Footnote_1631_1631" class="fnanchor">1631</a>
It is applied in wool, as a pessary, for affections of the uterus;
and with leek juice it is formed into plasters for diseases of
the genitals. This substance is macerated for forty days in
vinegar, in an earthen vessel luted with dung; after which it
acquires a saffron colour. When this composition is mixed with
an equal proportion of cadmia, it forms the medicament known
as ‚Äúpsoricon.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1632_1632"></a><a href="#Footnote_1632_1632" class="fnanchor">1632</a> If two parts of chalcitis are combined with
one of cadmia, the medicament becomes more active; and it is
rendered still more powerful if vinegar is used instead of wine.
For all these purposes, calcined chalcitis is the most efficacious.</p>

CHAP. 30.‚ÄîSORY: THREE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The sory<a id="FNanchor_1633_1633"></a><a href="#Footnote_1633_1633" class="fnanchor">1633</a> of Egypt is the most esteemed, being considered
much superior to that of Cyprus, Spain, and Africa; although
some prefer the sory from Cyprus for affections of the eyes.
But from whatever place it comes, the best is that which has
the strongest odour, and which, when triturated, becomes
greasy, black, and spongy. It is a substance so unpleasant to
the stomach, that some persons are made sick merely by its
smell. This is the case more particularly with the sory from
Egypt. That from other countries, by trituration, acquires
the lustre of misy, and is of a more gritty consistency. Held
in the mouth, and used as a collutory, it is good for toothache.
It is also useful for malignant ulcers of a serpiginous nature.
It is calcined upon charcoal, like chalcitis.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_31"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 31.‚ÄîMISY: THIRTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Some persons have stated, that misy<a id="FNanchor_1634_1634"></a><a href="#Footnote_1634_1634" class="fnanchor">1634</a> is formed by the calcination
of the mineral, in trenches;<a id="FNanchor_1635_1635"></a><a href="#Footnote_1635_1635" class="fnanchor">1635</a> its fine yellow powder
becoming mixed with the ashes of the burnt fire-wood.
The fact is, however, that though obtained from the mineral,
it is already formed, and in compact masses, which require
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>force to detach them. The best is that which comes from
the manufactories of Cyprus, its characteristics being, that
when broken, it sparkles like gold, and when triturated, it
presents a sandy or earthy appearance, like chalcitis. Misy
is used in the process of refining gold. Mixed with oil of
roses, it is used as an injection for suppurations of the ears,
and, in combination with wool, it is applied to ulcers of the
head. It also removes inveterate granulations of the eye-lids,
and is particularly useful for affections of the tonsils, quinsy,
and suppurations. For these maladies, sixteen drachm√¶
should be mixed with one semisextarius of vinegar, and boiled
with the addition of some honey, until it becomes of a viscous
consistency; in which state it is applicable to the different
purposes above mentioned. When its action is wanted to be
modified, a sprinkling of honey is added. A fomentation of
misy and vinegar removes the callosities of fistulous ulcers;
it also enters into the composition of eye-salves. It arrests
h√¶morrhage, prevents the spreading of serpiginous and putrid
ulcers, and consumes fleshy excrescences. It is particularly
useful for diseases of the male generative organs, and acts as
a check upon menstruation.</p>

CHAP. 32.‚ÄîCHALCANTHUM, OR SHOEMAKERS‚Äô BLACK: SIXTEEN
REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The Greeks, by the name<a id="FNanchor_1636_1636"></a><a href="#Footnote_1636_1636" class="fnanchor">1636</a> which they have given to it,
have indicated the relation between shoemakers‚Äô black<a id="FNanchor_1637_1637"></a><a href="#Footnote_1637_1637" class="fnanchor">1637</a> and
copper; for they call it ‚Äúchalcanthum.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1638_1638"></a><a href="#Footnote_1638_1638" class="fnanchor">1638</a> Indeed there is no
substance<a id="FNanchor_1639_1639"></a><a href="#Footnote_1639_1639" class="fnanchor">1639</a> so singular in its nature. It is prepared in Spain,
from the water of wells or pits which contain it in dissolution.
This water is boiled with an equal quantity of pure
water, and is then poured into large wooden reservoirs.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>Across these reservoirs there are a number of immovable
beams, to which cords are fastened, and then sunk into the water
beneath by means of stones; upon which, a slimy sediment
attaches itself to the cords, in drops of a vitreous<a id="FNanchor_1640_1640"></a><a href="#Footnote_1640_1640" class="fnanchor">1640</a> appearance,
somewhat resembling a bunch of grapes. Upon being removed,
it is dried for thirty days. It is of an azure colour, and of a
brilliant lustre, and is often taken for glass. When dissolved,
it forms the black dye that is used for colouring leather.</p>

<p>Chalcanthum is also prepared in various other ways: the
earth which contains it being sometimes excavated into
trenches, from the sides of which globules exude, which
become concrete when exposed to the action of the winter
frosts. This kind is called ‚Äústalagmia,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1641_1641"></a><a href="#Footnote_1641_1641" class="fnanchor">1641</a> and there is none
more pure. When its colour is nearly white, with a slight
tinge of violet, it is called ‚Äúlonchoton.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1642_1642"></a><a href="#Footnote_1642_1642" class="fnanchor">1642</a> It is also prepared
in pans hollowed out in the rocks; the rain water carrying the
slime into them, where it settles and becomes hardened. It is
also formed in the same way in which we prepare salt;<a id="FNanchor_1643_1643"></a><a href="#Footnote_1643_1643" class="fnanchor">1643</a> the
intense heat of the sun separating the fresh water from it.
Hence it is that some distinguish two kinds of chalcanthum,
the fossil and the artificial; the latter being paler than the
former, and as much inferior to it in quality as it is in
colour.</p>

<p>The chalcitis which comes from Cyprus is the most highly
esteemed for the purposes of medicine, being taken in doses of
one drachma with honey, as an expellent of intestinal worms.
Diluted and injected into the nostrils, it acts detergently
upon the brain, and, taken with honey or with hydromel, it
acts as a purgative upon the stomach. It removes granulations
upon the eye-lids, and is good for pains and films upon
the eyes; it is curative also of ulcerations of the mouth. It
arrests bleeding at the nostrils, and h√¶morrhoidal discharges.
In combination with seed of hyoscyamus, it brings away
splinters of broken bones. Applied to the forehead with a
sponge, it acts as a check upon defluxions of the eyes. Made
up into plasters, it is very efficacious as a detergent for sores
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>and fleshy excrescences in ulcers. The decoction of it, by the
contact solely, is curative of swellings of the uvula. It is laid
with linseed upon plasters which are used for relieving pains.
The whitish kind is preferred to the violet in one instance
only, for the purpose of being blown into the ears, through a
tube, to relieve deafness. Applied topically by itself, it heals
wounds; but it leaves a discoloration upon the scars. It has
been lately discovered, that if it is sprinkled upon the mouths
of bears and lions in the arena, its astringent action is so
powerful as to deprive the animals of the power of biting.</p>

found in the furnaces of copper-smelting works; the difference
between them being, that pompholyx is disengaged by washing,
while spodos is not washed. Some persons have called the
part which is white and very light ‚Äúpompholyx,‚Äù and say that
it is the ashes of copper and cadmia; whereas spodos is darker
and heavier, being a substance scraped from the walls of the
furnace, mixed with extinguished sparks from the metal, and
sometimes with the residue of coals. When vinegar is combined
with it, pompholyx emits a coppery smell, and if it is touched
with the tongue, the taste is most abominable. It is useful as
an ingredient in ophthalmic preparations for all diseases of the
eyes, as also for all the purposes for which spodos is used;
this last only differing from it in its action being less powerful.
It is also used for plasters, when required to be gently
cooling and desiccative. For all these purposes it is more
efficacious when it has been moistened with wine.</p>

<div class="section">

CHAP. 34.‚ÄîSPODOS: FIVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The Cyprian spodos<a id="FNanchor_1646_1646"></a><a href="#Footnote_1646_1646" class="fnanchor">1646</a> is the best. It is formed by fusing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>cadmia with copper ore. This substance, which is the lightest
part of the metal disengaged by fusion, escapes from the furnace,
and adheres to the roof, being distinguished from the
soot by the whiteness of its colour. Such parts of it as are
less white are indicative of incomplete combustion, and it is this
which some persons call ‚Äúpompholyx.‚Äù Such portions of it as
are of a more reddish colour are possessed of a more energetic
power, and are found to be so corrosive, that if it touches
the eyes, while being washed, it will cause blindness. There
is also a spodos of a honey colour, an indication that it contains
a large proportion of copper. All the different kinds,
however, are improved by washing; it being first skimmed with
a feather,<a id="FNanchor_1647_1647"></a><a href="#Footnote_1647_1647" class="fnanchor">1647</a> and afterwards submitted to a more substantial
washing, the harder grains being removed with the finger. That,
too, which has been washed with wine is more modified in its
effects; there being also some difference according to the kind of
wine that is used. When it has been washed with weak wine
the spodos is considered not so beneficial as an ingredient in
medicaments for the eyes; but the same kind of preparation is
more efficacious for running sores, and for ulcers of the mouth
attended with a discharge of matter, as well as in all those
remedies which are used for gangrene.</p>

<p>There is also a kind of spodos, called ‚Äúlauriotis,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1648_1648"></a><a href="#Footnote_1648_1648" class="fnanchor">1648</a> which
is made in the furnaces where silver is smelted. The kind,
however, that is best for the eyes, it is said, is that produced in

of art in which the ingenuity of man is more to be admired;
for it has discovered among the very commonest objects, a
substance that is in every way possessed of similar properties.</p>

<p>The substance called ‚Äúantispodos‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1649_1649"></a><a href="#Footnote_1649_1649" class="fnanchor">1649</a> is produced from the

with the more tender shoots of the branches. The
leaves, too, of the wild olive<a id="FNanchor_1650_1650"></a><a href="#Footnote_1650_1650" class="fnanchor">1650</a> furnish it, the cultivated olive,

<p>In the copper forges also smegma<a id="FNanchor_1654_1654"></a><a href="#Footnote_1654_1654" class="fnanchor">1654</a> is prepared. When the
metal is liquefied and thoroughly smelted, charcoal is added
to it and gradually kindled; after which, upon it being suddenly
acted upon by a powerful pair of bellows, a substance is
disengaged like a sort of copper chaff. The floor on which
it is received ought to be prepared with a stratum of coal-dust.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_37"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 37.‚ÄîDIPHRYX.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is another product of these furnaces, which is easily
distinguished from smegma, and which the Greeks call ‚Äúdiphryx,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1655_1655"></a><a href="#Footnote_1655_1655" class="fnanchor">1655</a>
from its being twice calcined. This substance is prepared
from three different sources. It is prepared, they say,
from a mineral pyrites, which is heated in the furnace until
it is converted by calcination into a red earth. It is also
made in Cyprus, from a slimy substance extracted from a certain
cavern there, which is first dried and then gradually heated,
by a fire made of twigs. A third way of making it, is from
the residue in the copper-furnaces that falls to the bottom.
The difference between the component parts of the ore is this:
the copper itself runs into the receivers, the scori√¶ make their
escape from the furnace, the flower becomes sublimated, and
the diphryx remains behind.</p>

<p>Some say that there are certain globules in the ore, while
being smelted, which become soldered together; and that the
rest of the metal is fused around it, the mass itself not becoming
liquefied, unless it is transferred to another furnace, and forming
a sort of knot, as it were, in the metal. That which remains
after the fusion, they say, is called ‚Äúdiphryx.‚Äù Its use in medicine
is similar to that of the substances mentioned above;<a id="FNanchor_1656_1656"></a><a href="#Footnote_1656_1656" class="fnanchor">1656</a> it

the Servilii is in possession of a sacred triens, to which they
offer every year a sacrifice, with the greatest care and magnificence;
the triens itself, they say, appears sometimes to increase
in size and sometimes to diminish; changes which indicate the
coming advancement or decadence of the family.‚Äù</p>

CHAP. 39 (14).‚ÄîIRON ORES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Next to copper we must give an account of the metal known
as iron, at the same time the most useful and the most fatal
instrument in the hand of mankind. For by the aid of iron
we lay open the ground, we plant trees, we prepare our vineyard-trees,<a id="FNanchor_1660_1660"></a><a href="#Footnote_1660_1660" class="fnanchor">1660</a>
and we force our vines each year to resume their
youthful state, by cutting away their decayed branches. It is
by the aid of iron that we construct houses, cleave rocks, and
perform so many other useful offices of life. But it is with
iron also that wars, murders, and robberies are effected, and
this, not only hand to hand, but from a distance even, by the
aid of missiles and winged weapons, now launched from engines,
now hurled by the human arm, and now furnished with
feathery wings. This last I regard as the most criminal
artifice that has been devised by the human mind; for, as
if to bring death upon man with still greater rapidity, we
have given wings to iron and taught it to fly.<a id="FNanchor_1661_1661"></a><a href="#Footnote_1661_1661" class="fnanchor">1661</a> Let us therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>acquit Nature of a charge that here belongs to man himself.<a id="FNanchor_1662_1662"></a><a href="#Footnote_1662_1662" class="fnanchor">1662</a></p>

<p>Indeed there have been some instances in which it has been
proved that iron might be solely used for innocent purposes.
In the treaty which Porsena granted to the Roman people, after
the expulsion of the kings, we find it expressly stipulated, that
iron shall be only employed for the cultivation of the fields;
and our oldest authors inform us, that in those days it was
considered unsafe to write with an iron pen.<a id="FNanchor_1663_1663"></a><a href="#Footnote_1663_1663" class="fnanchor">1663</a> There is an edict
extant, published in the third consulship of Pompeius Magnus,
during the tumults that ensued upon the death of Clodius,
prohibiting any weapon from being retained in the City.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_40"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 40.‚ÄîSTATUES OF IRON; CHASED WORKS IN IRON.</span></h3></div>

<p>Still, however, human industry has not failed to employ iron
for perpetuating the honours of more civilized life. The
artist Aristonidas, wishing to express the fury of Athamas
subsiding into repentance, after he had thrown his son Learchus
from the rock,<a id="FNanchor_1664_1664"></a><a href="#Footnote_1664_1664" class="fnanchor">1664</a> blended copper and iron, in order that the
blush of shame might be more exactly expressed, by the rust of
the iron making its appearance through the shining substance of
the copper; a statue which still exists at Rhodes. There is also,
in the same city, a Hercules of iron, executed by Alcon,<a id="FNanchor_1665_1665"></a><a href="#Footnote_1665_1665" class="fnanchor">1665</a> the
endurance displayed in his labours by the god having suggested
the idea. We see too, at Rome, cups of iron consecrated in
the Temple of Mars the Avenger.<a id="FNanchor_1666_1666"></a><a href="#Footnote_1666_1666" class="fnanchor">1666</a> Nature, in conformity
with her usual benevolence, has limited the power of iron, by
inflicting upon it the punishment of rust; and has thus displayed
her usual foresight in rendering nothing in existence
more perishable, than the substance which brings the greatest
dangers upon perishable mortality.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXIV_CHAP_41"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 41.‚ÄîTHE DIFFERENT KINDS OF IRON, AND THE MODE OF
TEMPERING IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>Iron ores are to be found almost everywhere; for they exist
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>even in the Italian island of Ilva,<a id="FNanchor_1667_1667"></a><a href="#Footnote_1667_1667" class="fnanchor">1667</a> being easily distinguished
by the ferruginous colour of the earth. The method of working
the ore is the same as that employed in the case of copper. In
Cappadocia, however, it is peculiarly questionable whether this
metal is present due to the water or to the earth; because,
when the latter has been saturated with the water of a certain
river, it yields, and then only, an iron that may be obtained
by smelting.</p>

<p>There are numerous varieties of iron ore; the chief causes
of which arise from differences in the soil and in the climate.
Some earths produce a metal that is soft, and nearly akin to
lead; others an iron that is brittle and coppery, the use of which
must be particularly avoided in making wheels or nails, the
former kind being better for these purposes. There is another
kind, again, which is only esteemed when cut into short lengths,
and is used for making hobnails;<a id="FNanchor_1668_1668"></a><a href="#Footnote_1668_1668" class="fnanchor">1668</a> and another which is
more particularly liable to rust. All these varieties are known
by the name of ‚Äústrictura,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1669_1669"></a><a href="#Footnote_1669_1669" class="fnanchor">1669</a> an appellation which is not used
with reference to the other metals, and is derived from the steel
that is used for giving an edge.<a id="FNanchor_1670_1670"></a><a href="#Footnote_1670_1670" class="fnanchor">1670</a> There is a great difference,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>too, in the smelting; some kinds producing knurrs of metal,
which are especially adapted for hardening into steel, or else,
prepared in another manner, for making thick anvils or heads
of hammers. But the main difference results from the quality of
the water into which the red-hot metal is plunged from time to
time. The water, which is in some places better for this purpose
than in others, has quite ennobled some localities for the
excellence of their iron, Bilbilis,<a id="FNanchor_1671_1671"></a><a href="#Footnote_1671_1671" class="fnanchor">1671</a> for example, and Turiasso<a id="FNanchor_1672_1672"></a><a href="#Footnote_1672_1672" class="fnanchor">1672</a>
in Spain, and Comum<a id="FNanchor_1673_1673"></a><a href="#Footnote_1673_1673" class="fnanchor">1673</a> in Italy; and this, although there are
no iron mines in these spots.</p>

<p>But of all the different kinds of iron, the palm of excellence
is awarded to that which is made by the Seres,<a id="FNanchor_1674_1674"></a><a href="#Footnote_1674_1674" class="fnanchor">1674</a> who send it to
us with their tissues and skins;<a id="FNanchor_1675_1675"></a><a href="#Footnote_1675_1675" class="fnanchor">1675</a> next to which, in quality, is
the Parthian<a id="FNanchor_1676_1676"></a><a href="#Footnote_1676_1676" class="fnanchor">1676</a> iron. Indeed, none of the other kinds of iron are
made of the pure hard metal, a softer alloy being welded with
them all. In our part of the world, a vein of ore is occasionally
found to yield a metal of this high quality, as in Noricum<a id="FNanchor_1677_1677"></a><a href="#Footnote_1677_1677" class="fnanchor">1677</a> for
instance; but, in other cases, it derives its value from the
mode of working it, as at Sulmo,<a id="FNanchor_1678_1678"></a><a href="#Footnote_1678_1678" class="fnanchor">1678</a> for example, a result owing
to the nature of its water, as already stated. It is to be observed
also, that in giving an edge to iron, there is a great difference
between oil-whetstones and water-whetstones,<a id="FNanchor_1679_1679"></a><a href="#Footnote_1679_1679" class="fnanchor">1679</a> the use
of oil producing a much finer edge. It is a remarkable fact,
that when the ore is fused, the metal becomes liquefied like
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>water, and afterwards acquires a spongy, brittle texture. It is
the practice to quench smaller articles made of iron with oil,
lest by being hardened in water they should be rendered brittle.
Human blood revenges itself upon iron; for if the metal has been
once touched by this blood it is much more apt to become rusty.</p>

CHAP. 42.‚ÄîTHE METAL CALLED LIVE IRON.</span></h3></div>

<p>We shall speak of the loadstone in its proper place,<a id="FNanchor_1680_1680"></a><a href="#Footnote_1680_1680" class="fnanchor">1680</a> and of
the sympathy which it has with iron. This is the only metal
that acquires the properties of that stone, retaining them for a
length of time, and attracting other iron, so that we may sometimes
see a whole chain formed of these rings. The lower
classes, in their ignorance, call this ‚Äúlive iron,‚Äù and the wounds
that are made by it are much more severe. This mineral is
also found in Cantabria, not in continuous strata, like the
genuine loadstone, but in scattered fragments, which they call
‚Äúbullationes.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1681_1681"></a><a href="#Footnote_1681_1681" class="fnanchor">1681</a> I do not know whether this species of ore is

it; but it certainly imparts the same property as the magnet
to iron. The architect Timochares,<a id="FNanchor_1683_1683"></a><a href="#Footnote_1683_1683" class="fnanchor">1683</a> began to erect a vaulted roof
of loadstone, in the Temple of Arsino√´,<a id="FNanchor_1684_1684"></a><a href="#Footnote_1684_1684" class="fnanchor">1684</a> at Alexandria, in order
that the iron statue of that princess might have the appearance
of hanging suspended in the air:<a id="FNanchor_1685_1685"></a><a href="#Footnote_1685_1685" class="fnanchor">1685</a> his death, however,
and that of King Ptolem√¶us, who had ordered this monument
to be erected in honour of his sister, prevented the completion
of the project.</p>

<p>Of all metals, the ores of iron are found in the greatest
abundance. In the maritime parts of Cantabria<a id="FNanchor_1686_1686"></a><a href="#Footnote_1686_1686" class="fnanchor">1686</a> which are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>washed by the Ocean, there is a steep and lofty mountain,
which, however incredible it may appear, is entirely composed
of this metal, as already stated in our description of the parts
bordering upon the Ocean.<a id="FNanchor_1687_1687"></a><a href="#Footnote_1687_1687" class="fnanchor">1687</a></p>

<p>Iron which has been acted upon by fire is spoiled, unless it
is forged with the hammer. It is not in a fit state for being
hammered when it is red-hot, nor, indeed, until it has begun to
assume a white heat. By sprinkling vinegar or alum upon it,
it acquires the appearance of copper. It is protected from
rust by an application of ceruse, gypsum, and tar; a property
of iron known by the Greeks as ‚Äúantipathia.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1688_1688"></a><a href="#Footnote_1688_1688" class="fnanchor">1688</a> Some pretend,
too, that this may be ensured by the performance of certain
religious ceremonies, and that there is in existence at the
city of Zeugma,<a id="FNanchor_1689_1689"></a><a href="#Footnote_1689_1689" class="fnanchor">1689</a> upon the Euphrates, an iron chain, by means
of which Alexander the Great constructed a bridge across the

<p>Iron is employed in medicine for other purposes besides that
of making incisions. For if a circle is traced with iron, or a
pointed weapon is carried three times round them, it will preserve
both infant and adult from all noxious influences: if
nails, too, that have been extracted from a tomb, are driven
into the threshold of a door, they will prevent night-mare.<a id="FNanchor_1691_1691"></a><a href="#Footnote_1691_1691" class="fnanchor">1691</a>
A slight puncture with the point of a weapon, with which a
man has been wounded, will relieve sudden pains, attended
with stitches in the sides or chest. Some affections are cured
by cauterization with red-hot iron, the bite of the mad dog
more particularly; for even if the malady has been fully developed,
and hydrophobia has made its appearance, the patient
is instantly relieved on the wound being cauterized.<a id="FNanchor_1692_1692"></a><a href="#Footnote_1692_1692" class="fnanchor">1692</a> Water

<p>Rust itself, too, is classed among the remedial substances;
for it was by means of it that Achilles cured Telephus, it is

iron is usually obtained for these purposes by scraping old nails

wounds, and is possessed of certain desiccative and astringent
properties. Applied in the form of a liniment, it is curative of
alopecy. Mixed with wax and myrtle-oil, it is applied to granulations
of the eyelids, and pustules in all parts of the body;
with vinegar it is used for the cure of erysipelas; and, applied
with lint, it is curative of itch, whitlows on the fingers, and
hang-nails. Used as a pessary with wool, it arrests female
discharges. Diluted in wine, and kneaded with myrrh, it is

barks made of osiers, covered with hides.<a id="FNanchor_1701_1701"></a><a href="#Footnote_1701_1701" class="fnanchor">1701</a> It is now known

sand found on the surface of the earth, and of a black colour,
and is only to be detected by its weight. It is mingled with
small pebbles, particularly in the dried beds of rivers. The
miners wash this sand, and calcine the deposit in the furnace.
It is also found in the gold mines that are known as ‚Äúaluti√¶,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1703_1703"></a><a href="#Footnote_1703_1703" class="fnanchor">1703</a>

the same weight<a id="FNanchor_1704_1704"></a><a href="#Footnote_1704_1704" class="fnanchor">1704</a> as gold. Hence it is that they remain with
the gold in the baskets in which it is collected; and being

into white lead.<a id="FNanchor_1705_1705"></a><a href="#Footnote_1705_1705" class="fnanchor">1705</a></p>

<p>Black lead is not procured in Gall√¶cia, although it is so

CHAP. 48. (17.)‚ÄîSTANNUM. ARGENTARIUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>When copper vessels are coated with stannum,<a id="FNanchor_1711_1711"></a><a href="#Footnote_1711_1711" class="fnanchor">1711</a> they produce
a less disagreeable flavour, and the formation of verdigris
is prevented; it is also remarkable, that the weight of the
vessel is not increased. As already mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_1712_1712"></a><a href="#Footnote_1712_1712" class="fnanchor">1712</a> the finest
mirrors were formerly prepared from it at Brundisium, until
everybody, our maid-servants even, began to use silver ones.
At the present day a counterfeit stannum is made, by adding
one-third of white copper to two-thirds of white lead.<a id="FNanchor_1713_1713"></a><a href="#Footnote_1713_1713" class="fnanchor">1713</a> It
is also counterfeited in another way, by mixing together equal
parts of white lead and black lead; this last being what is
called ‚Äúargentarium.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1714_1714"></a><a href="#Footnote_1714_1714" class="fnanchor">1714</a> There is also a composition called
‚Äútertiarium,‚Äù a mixture of two parts of black lead and one of
white: its price is twenty denarii per pound, and it is used
for soldering pipes. Persons still more dishonest mix together<a id="FNanchor_1715_1715"></a><a href="#Footnote_1715_1715" class="fnanchor">1715</a>
equal parts of tertiarium and white lead, and, calling the compound
‚Äúargentarium,‚Äù coat articles with it melted. This last
sells at sixty denarii per ten pounds, the price of the pure unmixed
white lead being eighty denarii, and of the black seven.<a id="FNanchor_1716_1716"></a><a href="#Footnote_1716_1716" class="fnanchor">1716</a></p>

<p>White lead is naturally more dry; while the black, on the
contrary, is always moist; consequently the white, without
being mixed with another metal, is of no use<a id="FNanchor_1717_1717"></a><a href="#Footnote_1717_1717" class="fnanchor">1717</a> for anything.
Silver too, cannot be soldered with it, because the silver becomes
fused before the white lead. It is confidently stated,
also, that if too small a proportion of black lead is mixed with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>the white, this last will corrode the silver. It was in the
Gallic provinces that the method was discovered of coating
articles of copper with white lead, so as to be scarcely distinguishable
from silver: articles thus plated are known as
‚Äúincoctilia.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1718_1718"></a><a href="#Footnote_1718_1718" class="fnanchor">1718</a> At a later period, the people of the town of
Alesia<a id="FNanchor_1719_1719"></a><a href="#Footnote_1719_1719" class="fnanchor">1719</a> began to use a similar process for plating articles with
silver, more particularly ornaments for horses, beasts of burden,
and yokes of oxen: the merit, however, of this invention
belongs to the Bituriges.<a id="FNanchor_1720_1720"></a><a href="#Footnote_1720_1720" class="fnanchor">1720</a> After this, they began to ornament
their esseda, colisata, and petorita<a id="FNanchor_1721_1721"></a><a href="#Footnote_1721_1721" class="fnanchor">1721</a> in a similar manner; and
luxury has at last arrived at such a pitch, that not only are
their decorations made of silver, but of gold even, and what
was formerly a marvel to behold on a cup, is now subjected to
the wear and tear of a carriage, and this in obedience to
what they call fashion!</p>

<p>White lead is tested, by pouring it, melted,<a id="FNanchor_1722_1722"></a><a href="#Footnote_1722_1722" class="fnanchor">1722</a> upon paper,
which ought to have the appearance of being torn rather by
the weight than by the heat of the metal. India has neither
copper nor lead,<a id="FNanchor_1723_1723"></a><a href="#Footnote_1723_1723" class="fnanchor">1723</a> but she procures them in exchange for her
precious stones and pearls.</p>

CHAP. 49.‚ÄîBLACK LEAD.</span></h3></div>

<p>Black lead<a id="FNanchor_1724_1724"></a><a href="#Footnote_1724_1724" class="fnanchor">1724</a> is used in the form of pipes and sheets: it is extracted
with great labour in Spain, and throughout all the Gallic
provinces; but in Britannia<a id="FNanchor_1725_1725"></a><a href="#Footnote_1725_1725" class="fnanchor">1725</a> it is found in the upper stratum of
the earth, in such abundance, that a law has been spontaneously
made, prohibiting any one from working more than a certain
quantity of it. The various kinds of black lead are known by
the following names‚Äîthe Ovetanian,<a id="FNanchor_1726_1726"></a><a href="#Footnote_1726_1726" class="fnanchor">1726</a> the Caprariensian,<a id="FNanchor_1727_1727"></a><a href="#Footnote_1727_1727" class="fnanchor">1727</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>and the Oleastrensian.<a id="FNanchor_1728_1728"></a><a href="#Footnote_1728_1728" class="fnanchor">1728</a> There is no difference whatever in
them, when the scoria has been carefully removed by calcination.
It is a marvellous fact, that these mines, and these only,
when they have been abandoned for some time, become replenished,
and are more prolific than before. This would
appear to be effected by the air, infusing itself at liberty
through the open orifices, just as some women become more
prolific after abortion. This was lately found to be the case
with the Santarensian mine in B√¶tica;<a id="FNanchor_1729_1729"></a><a href="#Footnote_1729_1729" class="fnanchor">1729</a> which, after being
farmed at an annual rental of two hundred thousand denarii,
and then abandoned, is now rented at two hundred and fifty-five
thousand per annum. In the same manner, the Antonian
mine in the same province has had the rent raised to four
hundred thousand sesterces per annum.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that if we pour water into a vessel
of lead, it will not melt; but that if we throw into the water
a pebble or a copper quadrans,<a id="FNanchor_1730_1730"></a><a href="#Footnote_1730_1730" class="fnanchor">1730</a> the vessel will be penetrated
by the fire.</p>

CHAP. 50. (18.)‚ÄîFIFTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM LEAD.</span></h3></div>

<p>Lead is used in medicine, without any addition, for the
removal of scars; if it is applied, too, in plates, to the region of
the loins and kidneys, in consequence of its cold nature it will
restrain the venereal passions, and put an end to libidinous
dreams at night, attended with spontaneous emissions, and assuming
all the form of a disease. The orator Calvus, it is said,
effected a cure for himself by means of these plates, and so preserved
his bodily energies for labour and study. The Emperor
Nero‚Äîfor so the gods willed it‚Äîcould never sing to the full
pitch of his voice, unless he had a plate of lead upon his chest;
thus showing us one method of preserving the voice.<a id="FNanchor_1731_1731"></a><a href="#Footnote_1731_1731" class="fnanchor">1731</a> For
medicinal purposes the lead is melted in earthen vessels; a layer
of finely powdered sulphur being placed beneath, very thin
plates of lead are laid upon it, and are then covered with a
mixture of sulphur and iron. While it is being melted, all
the apertures in the vessel should be closed, otherwise a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>noxious vapour is discharged from the furnace, of a deadly
nature, to dogs in particular. Indeed, the vapours from all
metals destroy flies and gnats; and hence it is that in mines
there are none of those annoyances.<a id="FNanchor_1732_1732"></a><a href="#Footnote_1732_1732" class="fnanchor">1732</a> Some persons, during the
process, mix lead-filings with the sulphur, while others substitute
ceruse for sulphur. By washing, a preparation is made
from lead, that is much employed in medicine: for this purpose,
a leaden mortar, containing rain water, is beaten with a
pestle of lead, until the water has assumed a thick consistency;
which done, the water that floats on the surface is removed
with a sponge, and the thicker part of the sediment is left to
dry, and is then divided into tablets. Some persons triturate
lead-filings in this way, and some mix with it lead ore, or
else vinegar, wine, grease, or rose-leaves. Others, again,
prefer triturating the lead in a stone mortar, one of Thebaic
stone more particularly, with a pestle of lead; by which
process a whiter preparation is obtained.</p>

<p>As to calcined lead, it is washed, like stibi<a id="FNanchor_1733_1733"></a><a href="#Footnote_1733_1733" class="fnanchor">1733</a> and cadmia.
Its action is astringent and repressive, and it is promotive of
cicatrization. The same substance is also employed in preparations
for the eyes, cases of procidence<a id="FNanchor_1734_1734"></a><a href="#Footnote_1734_1734" class="fnanchor">1734</a> of those organs more
particularly; also for filling up the cavities left by ulcers, and
for removing excrescences and fissures of the anus, as well as
h√¶morrhoidal and condylomatous tumours. For all these purposes
the lotion of lead is particularly useful; but for serpiginous
or sordid ulcers it is the ashes of calcined lead that are
used, these producing the same advantageous effects as ashes of
burnt papyrus.<a id="FNanchor_1735_1735"></a><a href="#Footnote_1735_1735" class="fnanchor">1735</a></p>

<p>The lead is calcined in thin plates, laid with sulphur in
shallow vessels, the mixture being stirred with iron rods or
stalks of fennel-giant, until the melted metal becomes calcined;
when cold, it is pulverized. Some persons calcine lead-filings
in a vessel of raw earth, which they leave in the
furnace, until the earthenware is completely baked. Others,
again, mix with it an equal quantity of ceruse or of barley, and
triturate it in the way mentioned for raw lead; indeed, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>lead which has been prepared this way is preferred to the
spodium of Cyprus.</p>

<p>The scoria<a id="FNanchor_1736_1736"></a><a href="#Footnote_1736_1736" class="fnanchor">1736</a> of lead is also made use of; the best kind being
that which approaches nearest to a yellow colour, without any
vestiges of lead, or which has the appearance of sulphur without
any terreous particles. It is broken into small pieces and
washed in a mortar, until the mortar assumes a yellow colour;
after which, it is poured off into a clean vessel, the process
being repeated until it deposits a sediment, which is a substance
of the greatest utility. It possesses the same properties
as lead, but of a more active nature. How truly wonderful is
the knowledge which we gain by experiment, when even the
very dregs and foul residues of substances have in so many
ways been tested by mankind!</p>

<p>A spodium<a id="FNanchor_1737_1737"></a><a href="#Footnote_1737_1737" class="fnanchor">1737</a> of lead is also prepared in the same manner as

water, in linen of a loose texture, and the earthy parts are
separated by pouring it off; after which it is sifted, and then
pounded. Some prefer removing the fine powder with a
feather, and then triturating it with aromatic wine.</p>

<p>Molybd√¶na,<a id="FNanchor_1739_1739"></a><a href="#Footnote_1739_1739" class="fnanchor">1739</a> which in another place I have called
‚Äúgalena,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1740_1740"></a><a href="#Footnote_1740_1740" class="fnanchor">1740</a> is a mineral compounded of silver and lead. It is
considered better in quality the nearer it approaches to a
golden colour and the less lead it contains; it is also friable,
and of moderate weight. When it is melted with oil, it
acquires the colour of liver. It is found adhering also to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>furnaces in which gold and silver have been smelted; and in this
case it is called ‚Äúmetallic.‚Äù The most esteemed kind is that
prepared at Zephyrium.<a id="FNanchor_1741_1741"></a><a href="#Footnote_1741_1741" class="fnanchor">1741</a> Those kinds, too, are considered the
best that are the least earthy and the least stony. It is used in
preparing lipar√¶,<a id="FNanchor_1742_1742"></a><a href="#Footnote_1742_1742" class="fnanchor">1742</a> as also for soothing or cooling ulcers, and as
an ingredient in plasters, which are applied without ligatures,
but are used only as a liniment for producing cicatrization on
the bodies of delicate persons and the more tender parts. The
composition is made of three pounds of molybd√¶na, one pound
of wax, and three hemin√¶ of oil; to which are added lees of
olives, in the case of aged persons. Combined with scum of
silver<a id="FNanchor_1743_1743"></a><a href="#Footnote_1743_1743" class="fnanchor">1743</a> and scoria of lead, it is employed warm in fomentations

CHAP. 54.‚ÄîPSIMITHIUM, OR CERUSE; SIX REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Psimithium,<a id="FNanchor_1744_1744"></a><a href="#Footnote_1744_1744" class="fnanchor">1744</a> which is also known as ceruse, is another
production of the lead-works. The most esteemed comes from
Rhodes. It is made from very fine shavings of lead, placed
over a vessel filled with the strongest vinegar; by which means
the shavings become dissolved. That which falls into the
vinegar is first dried, and then pounded and sifted, after
which it is again mixed with vinegar, and is then divided
into tablets and dried in the sun, during summer. It is also
made in another way; the lead is thrown into jars filled with
vinegar, which are kept closed for ten days; the sort of mould
that forms upon the surface is then scraped off, and the lead is
again put into the vinegar, until the whole of the metal is
consumed. The part that has been scraped off is triturated
and sifted, and then melted in shallow vessels, being stirred
with ladles, until the substance becomes red, and assumes the
appearance of sandarach. It is then washed with fresh water,
until all the cloudy impurities have disappeared, after which
it is dried as before, and divided into tablets.</p>

<p>Its properties are the same as those of the substances above
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_1745_1745"></a><a href="#Footnote_1745_1745" class="fnanchor">1745</a> It is, however, the mildest of all the preparations
of lead; in addition to which, it is also used by females
to whiten the complexion.<a id="FNanchor_1746_1746"></a><a href="#Footnote_1746_1746" class="fnanchor">1746</a> It is, however, like scum of
silver, a deadly poison. Melted a second time, ceruse becomes
red.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned nearly all the properties of
sandarach.<a id="FNanchor_1747_1747"></a><a href="#Footnote_1747_1747" class="fnanchor">1747</a> It is found both in gold-mines and in silver-mines.
The redder it is, the more pure and friable, and
the more powerful its odour, the better it is in quality. It is
detergent, astringent, heating, and corrosive, but is most remarkable
for its septic properties. Applied topically with
vinegar, it is curative of alopecy. It is also employed as an
ingredient in ophthalmic preparations. Used with honey, it
cleanses the fauces and makes the voice more clear and harmonious.
Taken with the food, in combination with turpentine,
it is a pleasant cure for cough and asthma. In the form
of a fumigation also, with cedar, it has a remedial effect upon
those complaints.<a id="FNanchor_1748_1748"></a><a href="#Footnote_1748_1748" class="fnanchor">1748</a></p>

<p>Arrhenicum,<a id="FNanchor_1749_1749"></a><a href="#Footnote_1749_1749" class="fnanchor">1749</a> too, is procured from the same sources. The
best in quality is of the colour of the finest gold; that which is
of a paler hue, or resembling sandarach, being less esteemed.
There is a third kind also, the colour of which is a mixture of
that of gold and of sandarach. The last two kinds are both of
them scaly, but the other is dry and pure, and divides into
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>delicate long veins.<a id="FNanchor_1750_1750"></a><a href="#Footnote_1750_1750" class="fnanchor">1750</a> This substance has the same virtues as
the one last mentioned, but is more active in its effects.
Hence it is that it enters into the composition of cauteries
and depilatory preparations. It is also used for the removal
of hangnails, polypi of the nostrils, condylomatous tumours,
and other kinds of excrescences. For the purpose of increasing
its energies, it is heated in a new earthen vessel, until it
changes its colour.<a id="FNanchor_1751_1751"></a><a href="#Footnote_1751_1751" class="fnanchor">1751</a></p>

has been treated of, by the Greeks more particularly, in a great
number of volumes. For my own part, I propose to employ a
due degree of brevity, at the same time omitting nothing that
is necessary or that is a product of Nature.</p>

<p>I shall begin then with what still remains to be said with
reference to painting, an art which was formerly illustrious,
when it was held in esteem both by kings and peoples, and
ennobling those whom it deigned to transmit to posterity.
But at the present day, it is completely banished in favour
of marble, and even gold. For not only are whole walls now
covered with marble, but the marble itself is carved out or
else marqueted so as to represent objects and animals of
various kinds. No longer now are we satisfied with formal
compartitions of marble, or with slabs extended like so many
mountains in our chambers, but we must begin to paint the
very stone itself! This art was invented in the reign of
Claudius, but it was in the time of Nero that we discovered the
method of inserting in marble spots that do not belong to it,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>and so varying its uniformity; and this, for the purpose of
representing the marble of Numidia<a id="FNanchor_1791_1791"></a><a href="#Footnote_1791_1791" class="fnanchor">1791</a> variegated with ovals,
and that of Synnada<a id="FNanchor_1792_1792"></a><a href="#Footnote_1792_1792" class="fnanchor">1792</a> veined with purple; just, in fact, as
luxury might have willed that Nature should produce them.
Such are our resources when the quarries fail us, and luxury
ceases not to busy itself, in order that as much as possible may
be lost whenever a conflagration happens.</p>

CHAP. 2. (2.)‚ÄîTHE HONOUR ATTACHED TO PORTRAITS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Correct portraits of individuals were formerly transmitted to
future ages by painting; but this has now completely fallen into
desuetude. Brazen shields are now set up, and silver faces, with
only some obscure traces of the countenance;<a id="FNanchor_1793_1793"></a><a href="#Footnote_1793_1793" class="fnanchor">1793</a> the very heads,
too, of statues are changed,<a id="FNanchor_1794_1794"></a><a href="#Footnote_1794_1794" class="fnanchor">1794</a> a thing that has given rise before
now to many a current sarcastic line; so true it is that people
prefer showing off the valuable material, to having a faithful
likeness. And yet, at the same time, we tapestry the walls of
our galleries with old pictures, and we prize the portraits of
strangers; while as to those made in honour of ourselves, we
esteem them only for the value of the material, for some heir to
break up and melt, and so forestall the noose and slip-knot of
the thief.<a id="FNanchor_1795_1795"></a><a href="#Footnote_1795_1795" class="fnanchor">1795</a> Thus it is that we possess the portraits of no
living individuals, and leave behind us the pictures of our
wealth, not of our persons.</p>

<p>And yet the very same persons adorn the pal√¶stra and the
anointing-room<a id="FNanchor_1796_1796"></a><a href="#Footnote_1796_1796" class="fnanchor">1796</a> with portraits of athletes, and both hang
up in their chamber and carry about them a likeness of
Epicurus.<a id="FNanchor_1797_1797"></a><a href="#Footnote_1797_1797" class="fnanchor">1797</a> On the twentieth day of each moon they celebrate
his birthday<a id="FNanchor_1798_1798"></a><a href="#Footnote_1798_1798" class="fnanchor">1798</a> by a sacrifice, and keep his festival,
known as the ‚ÄúIcas,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1799_1799"></a><a href="#Footnote_1799_1799" class="fnanchor">1799</a> every month: and these too, people who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>wish to live without being known!<a id="FNanchor_1800_1800"></a><a href="#Footnote_1800_1800" class="fnanchor">1800</a> So it is, most assuredly,
our indolence has lost sight of the arts, and since our minds
are destitute of any characteristic features, those of our bodies
are neglected also.</p>

<p>But on the contrary, in the days of our ancestors, it was
these that were to be seen in their halls, and not statues made
by foreign artists, or works in bronze or marble: portraits
modelled in wax<a id="FNanchor_1801_1801"></a><a href="#Footnote_1801_1801" class="fnanchor">1801</a> were arranged, each in its separate niche,
to be always in readiness to accompany the funeral processions
of the family;<a id="FNanchor_1802_1802"></a><a href="#Footnote_1802_1802" class="fnanchor">1802</a> occasions on which every member of the
family that had ever existed was always present. The pedigree,
too, of the individual was traced in lines upon each of
these coloured portraits. Their muniment-rooms,<a id="FNanchor_1803_1803"></a><a href="#Footnote_1803_1803" class="fnanchor">1803</a> too, were
filled with archives and memoirs, stating what each had done
when holding the magistracy. On the outside, again, of their
houses, and around the thresholds of their doors, were placed
other statues of those mighty spirits, in the spoils of the enemy
there affixed, memorials which a purchaser even was not
allowed to displace; so that the very house continued to
triumph even after it had changed its master. A powerful
stimulus to emulation this, when the walls each day reproached
an unwarlike owner for having thus intruded upon
the triumphs of another! There is still extant an address by
the orator Messala, full of indignation, in which he forbids
that there should be inserted among the images of his family
any of those of the stranger race of the L√¶vini.<a id="FNanchor_1804_1804"></a><a href="#Footnote_1804_1804" class="fnanchor">1804</a> It was the
same feeling, too, that extorted from old Messala those compilations
of his ‚ÄúOn the Families of Rome;‚Äù when, upon
passing through the hall of Scipio Pomponianus,<a id="FNanchor_1805_1805"></a><a href="#Footnote_1805_1805" class="fnanchor">1805</a> he observed
that, in consequence of a testamentary adoption, the Salvittos<a id="FNanchor_1806_1806"></a><a href="#Footnote_1806_1806" class="fnanchor">1806</a>‚Äîfor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>that had been their surname‚Äîto the disgrace of the
Africani, had surreptitiously contrived to assume the name of
the Scipios. But the Messalas must pardon me if I remark,
that to lay a claim, though an untruthful one, to the statues
of illustrious men, shows some love for their virtues, and is
much more honourable than to have such a character as to
merit that no one should wish to claim them.</p>

<p>There is a new invention too, which we must not omit to
notice. Not only do we consecrate in our libraries, in gold
or silver, or at all events, in bronze, those whose immortal
spirits hold converse with us in those places, but we even go
so far as to reproduce the ideal of features, all remembrance of
which has ceased to exist; and our regrets give existence to
likenesses that have not been transmitted to us, as in the case
of Homer, for example.<a id="FNanchor_1807_1807"></a><a href="#Footnote_1807_1807" class="fnanchor">1807</a> And indeed, it is my opinion, that
nothing can be a greater proof of having achieved success in
life, than a lasting desire on the part of one‚Äôs fellow-men, to
know what one‚Äôs features were. This practice of grouping
portraits was first introduced at Rome by Asinius Pollio,
who was also the first to establish a public library, and so
make the works of genius the property of the public.
Whether the kings of Alexandria and of Pergamus, who had
so energetically rivalled each other in forming libraries, had
previously introduced this practice, I cannot so easily say.</p>

<p>That a strong passion for portraits formerly existed, is
attested both by Atticus, the friend of Cicero, who wrote a
work on this subject,<a id="FNanchor_1808_1808"></a><a href="#Footnote_1808_1808" class="fnanchor">1808</a> and by M. Varro, who conceived the
very liberal idea of inserting, by some means<a id="FNanchor_1809_1809"></a><a href="#Footnote_1809_1809" class="fnanchor">1809</a> or other, in his
numerous volumes, the portraits of seven hundred individuals;
as he could not bear the idea that all traces of their features
should be lost, or that the lapse of centuries should get the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>better of mankind. Thus was he the inventor of a benefit to
his fellow-men, that might have been envied by the gods
themselves; for not only did he confer upon them immortality,
but he transmitted them, too, to all parts of the earth; so that
everywhere it might be possible for them to be present, and
for each to occupy his niche. This service, too, Varro conferred
upon persons who were no members of his own family.</p>

CHAP. 3. (3.)‚ÄîWHEN SHIELDS WERE FIRST INVENTED WITH
PORTRAITS UPON THEM; AND WHEN THEY WERE FIRST ERECTED
IN PUBLIC.</span></h3></div>

<p>So far as I can learn, Appius Claudius, who was consul
with P. Servilius, in the year of the City, 259, was the first to
dedicate shields<a id="FNanchor_1810_1810"></a><a href="#Footnote_1810_1810" class="fnanchor">1810</a> in honour of his own family in a sacred or
public place.<a id="FNanchor_1811_1811"></a><a href="#Footnote_1811_1811" class="fnanchor">1811</a> For he placed representations of his ancestors
in the Temple of Bellona, and desired that they might be
erected in an elevated spot, so as to be seen, and the inscriptions
reciting their honours read. A truly graceful device;
more particularly when a multitude of children, represented
by so many tiny figures, displays those germs, as it were,
which are destined to continue the line: shields such as these,
no one can look at without a feeling of pleasure and lively
interest.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_4"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 4.‚ÄîWHEN THESE SHIELDS WERE FIRST PLACED IN
PRIVATE HOUSES.</span></h3></div>

<p>More recently, M. √Ümilius, who was consul<a id="FNanchor_1812_1812"></a><a href="#Footnote_1812_1812" class="fnanchor">1812</a> with Quintus
Lutatius, not only erected these shields in the √Ümilian
Basilica,<a id="FNanchor_1813_1813"></a><a href="#Footnote_1813_1813" class="fnanchor">1813</a> but in his own house as well; in doing which
he followed a truly warlike example. For, in fact, these
portraits were represented on bucklers, similar to those used
in the Trojan War;<a id="FNanchor_1814_1814"></a><a href="#Footnote_1814_1814" class="fnanchor">1814</a> and hence it is that these shields received
their present name of ‚Äúclypei,‚Äù and not, as the perverse
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>subtleties of the grammarians will have it, from the word
‚Äúcluo.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1815_1815"></a><a href="#Footnote_1815_1815" class="fnanchor">1815</a> It was an abundant motive for valour, when upon
each shield was represented the features of him who had borne
it. The Carthaginians used to make both their bucklers and their
portraits of gold, and to carry them with them in the camp: at
all events, Marcius, the avenger of the Scipios<a id="FNanchor_1816_1816"></a><a href="#Footnote_1816_1816" class="fnanchor">1816</a> in Spain, found
one of this kind on capturing the camp of Hasdrubal, and it
was this same buckler that remained suspended over the gate of
the Capitoline Temple until the time when it was first burnt.<a id="FNanchor_1817_1817"></a><a href="#Footnote_1817_1817" class="fnanchor">1817</a>
Indeed, in the days of our ancestors, so assured was the safety
of these shields, that it has been a subject of remark, that in
the consulship of L. Manlius and Q. Fulvius, in the year of
the City, 575, M. Aufidius, who had given security for the
safety of the Capitol, informed the senate that the bucklers
there which for some lustra<a id="FNanchor_1818_1818"></a><a href="#Footnote_1818_1818" class="fnanchor">1818</a> had been assessed as copper,
were in reality made of silver.</p>

CHAP. 5.‚ÄîTHE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ART OF PAINTING. MONOCHROME
PAINTINGS. THE EARLIEST PAINTERS.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have no certain knowledge as to the commencement of
the art of painting, nor does this enquiry fall under our consideration.
The Egyptians assert that it was invented among
themselves, six thousand years before it passed into Greece; a
vain boast, it is very evident.<a id="FNanchor_1819_1819"></a><a href="#Footnote_1819_1819" class="fnanchor">1819</a> As to the Greeks, some say
that it was invented at Sicyon, others at Corinth; but they
all agree that it originated in tracing lines round the human
shadow.<a id="FNanchor_1820_1820"></a><a href="#Footnote_1820_1820" class="fnanchor">1820</a> The first stage of the art, they say, was this, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>second stage being the employment of single colours; a process
known as ‚Äúmonochromaton,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1821_1821"></a><a href="#Footnote_1821_1821" class="fnanchor">1821</a> after it had become more
complicated, and which is still in use at the present day.
The invention of line-drawing has been assigned to Philocles,
the Egyptian, or to Cleanthes<a id="FNanchor_1822_1822"></a><a href="#Footnote_1822_1822" class="fnanchor">1822</a> of Corinth. The first
who practised this line-drawing were Aridices, the Corinthian,
and Telephanes, the Sicyonian, artists who, without making
use of any colours, shaded the interior of the outline by
drawing lines;<a id="FNanchor_1823_1823"></a><a href="#Footnote_1823_1823" class="fnanchor">1823</a> hence, it was the custom with them to add to
the picture the name of the person represented. Ecphantus,
the Corinthian, was the first to employ colours upon these
pictures, made, it is said, of broken earthenware, reduced to
powder. We shall show on a future<a id="FNanchor_1824_1824"></a><a href="#Footnote_1824_1824" class="fnanchor">1824</a> occasion, that it was a
different artist of the same name, who, according to Cornelius
Nepos, came to Italy with Demaratus, the father of the Roman
king, Tarquinius Priscus, on his flight from Corinth to escape
the violence of the tyrant Cypselus.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_6"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 6.‚ÄîTHE ANTIQUITY OF PAINTING IN ITALY.</span></h3></div>

<p>But already, in fact, had the art of painting been perfectly
developed in Italy.<a id="FNanchor_1825_1825"></a><a href="#Footnote_1825_1825" class="fnanchor">1825</a> At all events, there are extant in the
temples at Ardea, at this day, paintings of greater antiquity
than Rome itself; in which, in my opinion, nothing is more
marvellous, than that they should have remained so long
unprotected by a roof, and yet preserving their freshness.<a id="FNanchor_1826_1826"></a><a href="#Footnote_1826_1826" class="fnanchor">1826</a> At
Lanuvium, too, it is the same, where we see an Atalanta and a
Helena, without drapery, close together, and painted by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>same artist. They are both of the greatest beauty, the former
being evidently the figure of a virgin, and they still remain
uninjured, though the temple is in ruins. The Emperor
Caius,<a id="FNanchor_1827_1827"></a><a href="#Footnote_1827_1827" class="fnanchor">1827</a> inflamed with lustfulness, attempted to have them
removed, but the nature of the plaster would not admit of it.
There are in existence at C√¶re,<a id="FNanchor_1828_1828"></a><a href="#Footnote_1828_1828" class="fnanchor">1828</a> some paintings of a still higher
antiquity. Whoever carefully examines them, will be forced
to admit that no art has arrived more speedily at perfection,
seeing that it evidently was not in existence at the time
of the Trojan War.<a id="FNanchor_1829_1829"></a><a href="#Footnote_1829_1829" class="fnanchor">1829</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_7"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 7. (4.)‚ÄîROMAN PAINTERS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Among the Romans, too, this art very soon rose into esteem,
for it was from it that the Fabii, a most illustrious family, derived
their surname of ‚ÄúPictor;‚Äù indeed the first of the family
who bore it, himself painted the Temple of Salus,<a id="FNanchor_1830_1830"></a><a href="#Footnote_1830_1830" class="fnanchor">1830</a> in the year
of the City, 450; a work which lasted to our own times, but was
destroyed when the temple was burnt, in the reign of Claudius.
Next in celebrity were the paintings of the poet Pacuvius, in
the Temple of Hercules, situate in the Cattle Market:<a id="FNanchor_1831_1831"></a><a href="#Footnote_1831_1831" class="fnanchor">1831</a> he was
a son of the sister of Ennius, and the fame of the art was
enhanced at Rome by the success of the artist on the stage.
After this period, the art was no longer practised by men of
rank; unless, indeed, we would make reference to Turpilius,
in our own times, a native of Venetia, and of equestrian rank,
several of whose beautiful works are still in existence at
Verona. He painted, too, with his left hand, a thing never
known to have been done by any one before.<a id="FNanchor_1832_1832"></a><a href="#Footnote_1832_1832" class="fnanchor">1832</a></p>

<p>Titidius Labeo, a person of pr√¶torian rank, who had been
formerly proconsul of the province of Gallia Narbonensis, and
who lately died at a very advanced age, used to pride himself
upon the little pictures which he executed, but it only caused
him to be ridiculed and sneered at. I must not omit, too, to
mention a celebrated consultation upon the subject of painting,
which was held by some persons of the highest rank.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>Q. Pedius,<a id="FNanchor_1833_1833"></a><a href="#Footnote_1833_1833" class="fnanchor">1833</a> who had been honoured with the consulship and a
triumph, and who had been named by the Dictator C√¶sar as
co-heir with Augustus, had a grandson, who being dumb from
his birth, the orator Messala, to whose family his grandmother
belonged, recommended that he should be brought up as a
painter, a proposal which was also approved of by the late
Emperor Augustus. He died, however, in his youth, after
having made great progress in the art. But the high estimation
in which painting came to be held at Rome, was principally
due, in my opinion, to M. Valerius Maximus Messala,
who, in the year of the City, 490, was the first to exhibit a
painting to the public; a picture, namely, of the battle in
which he had defeated the Carthaginians and Hiero in Sicily,
upon one side of the Curia Hostilia.<a id="FNanchor_1834_1834"></a><a href="#Footnote_1834_1834" class="fnanchor">1834</a> The same thing was done,
too, by L. Scipio,<a id="FNanchor_1835_1835"></a><a href="#Footnote_1835_1835" class="fnanchor">1835</a> who placed in the Capitol a painting of the
victory which he had gained in Asia; but his brother Africanus,
it is said, was offended at it, and not without reason, for his
son had been taken prisoner in the battle.<a id="FNanchor_1836_1836"></a><a href="#Footnote_1836_1836" class="fnanchor">1836</a> Lucius Hostilius
Mancinus,<a id="FNanchor_1837_1837"></a><a href="#Footnote_1837_1837" class="fnanchor">1837</a> too, who had been the first to enter Carthage at the
final attack, gave a very similar offence to √Ümilianus,<a id="FNanchor_1838_1838"></a><a href="#Footnote_1838_1838" class="fnanchor">1838</a> by
exposing in the Forum a painting of that city and the attack
upon it, he himself standing near the picture, and describing
to the spectators the various details of the siege; a piece of
complaisance which secured him the consulship at the ensuing
Comitia.</p>

<p>The stage, too, which was erected for the games celebrated
by Claudius Pulcher,<a id="FNanchor_1839_1839"></a><a href="#Footnote_1839_1839" class="fnanchor">1839</a> brought the art of painting into great
admiration, it being observed that the ravens were so deceived
by the resemblance, as to light upon the decorations
which were painted in imitation of tiles.</p>

CHAP. 8.‚ÄîAT WHAT PERIOD FOREIGN PAINTINGS WERE FIRST
INTRODUCED AT ROME.</span></h3></div>

<p>The high estimation in which the paintings of foreigners were
held at Rome commenced with Lucius Mummius, who, from
his victories, acquired the surname of ‚ÄúAchaicus.‚Äù For upon
the sale of the spoil on that occasion, King Attalus having purchased,
at the price of six thousand denarii, a painting of Father
Liber by Aristides,<a id="FNanchor_1840_1840"></a><a href="#Footnote_1840_1840" class="fnanchor">1840</a> Mummius, feeling surprised at the
price, and suspecting that there might be some merit in it of
which he himself was unaware,<a id="FNanchor_1841_1841"></a><a href="#Footnote_1841_1841" class="fnanchor">1841</a> in spite of the complaints of
Attalus, broke off the bargain, and had the picture placed in
the Temple of Ceres;<a id="FNanchor_1842_1842"></a><a href="#Footnote_1842_1842" class="fnanchor">1842</a> the first instance, I conceive, of a foreign
painting being publicly exhibited at Rome.</p>

<p>After this, I find, it became a common practice to exhibit
foreign pictures in the Forum; for it was to this circumstance
that we are indebted for a joke of the orator Crassus. While
pleading below the Old Shops,<a id="FNanchor_1843_1843"></a><a href="#Footnote_1843_1843" class="fnanchor">1843</a> he was interrupted by a witness
who had been summoned, with the question, ‚ÄúTell me then,
Crassus, what do you take me to be?‚Äù ‚ÄúVery much like
him,‚Äù answered he, pointing to the figure of a Gaul in a picture,
thrusting out his tongue in a very unbecoming manner.<a id="FNanchor_1844_1844"></a><a href="#Footnote_1844_1844" class="fnanchor">1844</a>
It was in the Forum, too, that was placed the picture of the
Old Shepherd leaning on his staff; respecting which, when the
envoy of the Teutones was asked what he thought was the
value of it, he made answer that he would rather not have
the original even, at a gift.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_9"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 9.‚ÄîAT WHAT PERIOD PAINTING WAS FIRST HELD IN HIGH
ESTEEM AT ROME, AND FROM WHAT CAUSES.</span></h3></div>

<p>But it was the Dictator C√¶sar that first brought the public
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>exhibition of pictures into such high estimation, by consecrating
an Ajax and a Medea<a id="FNanchor_1845_1845"></a><a href="#Footnote_1845_1845" class="fnanchor">1845</a> before the Temple of Venus Genetrix.<a id="FNanchor_1846_1846"></a><a href="#Footnote_1846_1846" class="fnanchor">1846</a>
After him there was M. Agrippa, a man who was naturally more
attached to rustic simplicity than to refinement. Still, however,
we have a magnificent oration of his, and one well worthy of
the greatest of our citizens, on the advantage of exhibiting in
public all pictures and statues; a practice which would have
been far preferable to sending them into banishment at our
country-houses. Severe as he was in his tastes, he paid the
people of Cyzicus twelve hundred thousand sesterces for two
paintings, an Ajax and a Venus. He also ordered small paintings
to be set in marble in the very hottest part of his Warm
Baths;<a id="FNanchor_1847_1847"></a><a href="#Footnote_1847_1847" class="fnanchor">1847</a> where they remained until they were removed a short
time since, when the building was repaired.</p>

he consecrated in the Comitium;<a id="FNanchor_1853_1853"></a><a href="#Footnote_1853_1853" class="fnanchor">1853</a> one of which was a Nemea<a id="FNanchor_1854_1854"></a><a href="#Footnote_1854_1854" class="fnanchor">1854</a>
seated upon a lion, and bearing a palm in her hand. Close to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>her is an Old Man, standing with a staff, and above his head
hangs the picture of a chariot with two horses. Nicias<a id="FNanchor_1855_1855"></a><a href="#Footnote_1855_1855" class="fnanchor">1855</a> has
written upon this picture that he ‚Äúinburned‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1856_1856"></a><a href="#Footnote_1856_1856" class="fnanchor">1856</a> it, such being
the word he has employed.</p>

<p>In the second picture the thing to be chiefly admired, is the
resemblance that the youth bears to the old man his father,
allowing, of course, for the difference in age; above them soars
an eagle, which grasps a dragon in its talons. Philochares<a id="FNanchor_1857_1857"></a><a href="#Footnote_1857_1857" class="fnanchor">1857</a>
attests that he is the author of this work, an instance, if we
only consider it, of the mighty power wielded by the pictorial
art; for here, thanks to Philochares, the senate of the Roman
people, age after age, has before its eyes Glaucion and his son
Aristippus, persons who would otherwise have been altogether
unknown. The Emperor Tiberius, too, a prince who was by
no means very gracious, has exhibited in the temple dedicated
by him, in his turn, to Augustus, several pictures which
we shall describe hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_1858_1858"></a><a href="#Footnote_1858_1858" class="fnanchor">1858</a></p>

CHAP. 11. (5.)‚ÄîTHE ART OF PAINTING.</span></h3></div>

<p>Thus much then with reference to the dignity of this now
expiring art. We have already<a id="FNanchor_1859_1859"></a><a href="#Footnote_1859_1859" class="fnanchor">1859</a> stated with what single
colours the earlier artists painted, when speaking of these
pigments under the head of metals. The new modes of
painting which were afterwards discovered, and are known as
‚Äúneogrammatea,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1860_1860"></a><a href="#Footnote_1860_1860" class="fnanchor">1860</a> the names of the artists, their different inventions,
and the periods at which these inventions were adopted,
will all be described when we come to enumerate the painters:
for the present, however, the proposed plan of this work
requires, that I should enlarge upon the nature of the several
colours that are employed.</p>

<p>The art of painting at last became developed, in the invention
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>of light and shade, the alternating contrast of the colours
serving to heighten the effect of each. At a later period, again,
lustre<a id="FNanchor_1861_1861"></a><a href="#Footnote_1861_1861" class="fnanchor">1861</a> was added, a thing altogether different from light. The
gradation between lustre and light on the one hand and shade
on the other, was called ‚Äútonos;‚Äù while the blending of the
various tints, and their passing into one another, was known as
‚Äúharmoge.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1862_1862"></a><a href="#Footnote_1862_1862" class="fnanchor">1862</a></p>

CHAP. 12. (6.)‚ÄîPIGMENTS OTHER THAN THOSE OF A METALLIC
ORIGIN. ARTIFICIAL COLOURS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Colours are either<a id="FNanchor_1863_1863"></a><a href="#Footnote_1863_1863" class="fnanchor">1863</a> sombre or florid, these qualities arising
either from the nature, of the substances or their mode of combination.
The florid colours are those which the employer
supplies<a id="FNanchor_1864_1864"></a><a href="#Footnote_1864_1864" class="fnanchor">1864</a> to the painter at his own expense; minium,<a id="FNanchor_1865_1865"></a><a href="#Footnote_1865_1865" class="fnanchor">1865</a>
namely, armenium, cinnabaris,<a id="FNanchor_1866_1866"></a><a href="#Footnote_1866_1866" class="fnanchor">1866</a> chrysocolla,<a id="FNanchor_1867_1867"></a><a href="#Footnote_1867_1867" class="fnanchor">1867</a> indicum, and
purpurissum. The others are the sombre colours. Taking
both kinds together, some are native colours, and others are
artificial. Sinopis, rubrica, par√¶tonium, melinum, eretria and
orpiment, are native colours. The others are artificial, more
particularly those described by us when speaking of metals;
in addition to which there are, among the more common colours,
ochra, usta or burnt ceruse, sandarach, sandyx, syricum, and
atramentum.</p>

<div class="section">

CHAP. 13.‚ÄîSINOPIS: ELEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Sinopis<a id="FNanchor_1868_1868"></a><a href="#Footnote_1868_1868" class="fnanchor">1868</a> was discovered in Pontus; and hence its name,
from the city of Sinope there. It is produced also in Egypt,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>the Balearic islands, and Africa; but the best is found in
Lemnos and Cappadocia, being extracted from quarries there.
That part is considered the best which has been found adhering
to the rock. In the native mass, it has its own proper colour
within, but is spotted on the exterior; the ancients made use
of it for tone.<a id="FNanchor_1869_1869"></a><a href="#Footnote_1869_1869" class="fnanchor">1869</a></p>

<p>There are three kinds of sinopis, the red, the pale red, and
the intermediate. The price of the best is twelve denarii per
pound; it is used both for painting with the brush, and for
colouring wood. The kind which comes from Africa sells at
eight asses per pound; the name given to it is ‚Äúcicerculum.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1870_1870"></a><a href="#Footnote_1870_1870" class="fnanchor">1870</a>
That<a id="FNanchor_1871_1871"></a><a href="#Footnote_1871_1871" class="fnanchor">1871</a> which is of the deepest red is the most in use for
colouring compartitions. The sinopis known as the dull<a id="FNanchor_1872_1872"></a><a href="#Footnote_1872_1872" class="fnanchor">1872</a>
kind, being of a very tawny complexion, sells also at the price
of eight asses per pound; it is used principally for the lower<a id="FNanchor_1873_1873"></a><a href="#Footnote_1873_1873" class="fnanchor">1873</a>
parts of compartitions.</p>

<p>Used medicinally, sinopis is of a soothing nature, and is employed
as an ingredient in plasters and emollient poultices.
It admits of being easily used, whether in the form of a dry
or of a liquid composition, for the cure of ulcers situate in the
humid parts of the body, the mouth and the rectum, for instance.
Used as an injection, it arrests looseness of the bowels,
and, taken in doses of one denarius, it acts as a check upon
female discharges. Applied in a burnt state, with wine in
particular, it has a desiccative effect upon granulations of the
eyelids.</p>

CHAP. 14.‚ÄîRUBRICA; LEMNIAN EARTH: FOUR REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Some persons have wished to make out that sinopis is
nothing else but a kind of rubrica<a id="FNanchor_1874_1874"></a><a href="#Footnote_1874_1874" class="fnanchor">1874</a> of second-rate quality,
looking upon earth of Lemnos as a rubrics of the highest
quality. This last approaches very nearly to minium,<a id="FNanchor_1875_1875"></a><a href="#Footnote_1875_1875" class="fnanchor">1875</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>was as highly esteemed among the ancients as the island that
produces it: it was never sold except in sealed packages, a circumstance
to which it was indebted for its additional name of
‚Äúsphragis.‚Äù It is with this material that they give the under-coating
to minium, in the adulteration of which it is also extensively
employed.</p>

<p>In medicine it is very highly esteemed. Applied to the
eyes in the form of a liniment, it allays defluxions and pains
in those organs, and arrests the discharges from lachrymal
fistulas. To persons vomiting blood, it is administered with
vinegar to drink. It is taken also internally for affections of
the spleen and kidneys; and by females for the purpose of
arresting flooding. It is employed too, to counteract the
effects of poisons, and of stings inflicted by sea or land serpents;
hence it is that it is so commonly used as an ingredient
in antidotes.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_15"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 15.‚ÄîEGYPTIAN EARTH.</span></h3></div>

<p>Of the other kinds of rubrica, those of Egypt and Africa are
of the greatest utility to workers in wood, from the fact of
their being absorbed with the greatest rapidity. They are
used also for painting, and are found in a native state in iron-mines.<a id="FNanchor_1876_1876"></a><a href="#Footnote_1876_1876" class="fnanchor">1876</a></p>

<p>It is from rubrica also, that ochra<a id="FNanchor_1877_1877"></a><a href="#Footnote_1877_1877" class="fnanchor">1877</a> is prepared, the rubrica
being burnt<a id="FNanchor_1878_1878"></a><a href="#Footnote_1878_1878" class="fnanchor">1878</a> in new earthen pots well luted with clay. The
more highly it is calcined in the furnace, the better the
colour is. All kinds of rubrica are of a desiccative nature, and
hence it is that they are so useful for plasters, and as an application
even for erysipelas.</p>

<p>Par√¶tonium<a id="FNanchor_1882_1882"></a><a href="#Footnote_1882_1882" class="fnanchor">1882</a> is so called from the place<a id="FNanchor_1883_1883"></a><a href="#Footnote_1883_1883" class="fnanchor">1883</a> of that name in
Egypt. It is sea-foam,<a id="FNanchor_1884_1884"></a><a href="#Footnote_1884_1884" class="fnanchor">1884</a> they say, solidified with slime, and
hence it is that minute shells are often found in it. It is prepared
also in the Isle of Crete, and at Cyren√¶. At Rome, it is
adulterated with Cimolian<a id="FNanchor_1885_1885"></a><a href="#Footnote_1885_1885" class="fnanchor">1885</a> earth, boiled and thickened. The
price of that of the highest quality is fifty denarii per six
pounds. This is the most unctuous of all the white colours,
and the most tenacious as a coating for plaster, the result of
its smoothness.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_19"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 19.‚ÄîMELINUM: SIX REMEDIES. CERUSE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Melinum, too, is a white colour, the best being the produce
of the Isle of Melos.<a id="FNanchor_1886_1886"></a><a href="#Footnote_1886_1886" class="fnanchor">1886</a> It is found also in Samos; but this
last kind is never used by painters, in consequence of its being
too unctuous. The persons employed in extracting it, lie at
full length upon the ground, and search for the veins among the
rocks. In medicine it is employed for much the same purposes
as eretria;<a id="FNanchor_1887_1887"></a><a href="#Footnote_1887_1887" class="fnanchor">1887</a> in addition to which, it dries the tongue, acts as
a depilatory, and has a soothing effect. The price of it is one
sestertius per pound.</p>

<p>The third of the white pigments is ceruse, the nature of
which we have already<a id="FNanchor_1888_1888"></a><a href="#Footnote_1888_1888" class="fnanchor">1888</a> explained when speaking of the ores
of lead; there was also a native ceruse, formerly found on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>lands of Theodotus at Smyrna, which the ancients made use of
for painting ships. At the present day, all ceruse is prepared
artificially, from lead and vinegar,<a id="FNanchor_1889_1889"></a><a href="#Footnote_1889_1889" class="fnanchor">1889</a> as already stated.</p>

<p>Usta<a id="FNanchor_1890_1890"></a><a href="#Footnote_1890_1890" class="fnanchor">1890</a> was accidentally discovered at a fire in the Pir√¶us,
some ceruse having been burnt in the jars there. Nicias, the
artist above-mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_1891_1891"></a><a href="#Footnote_1891_1891" class="fnanchor">1891</a> was the first to use it. At the
present day, that of Asia, known also as ‚Äúpurpurea,‚Äù is considered
the best. The price of it is six denarii per pound. It
is prepared also at Rome by calcining marbled sil,<a id="FNanchor_1892_1892"></a><a href="#Footnote_1892_1892" class="fnanchor">1892</a> and

it. Nicomachus<a id="FNanchor_1895_1895"></a><a href="#Footnote_1895_1895" class="fnanchor">1895</a> and Parrhasius made use of it. In a medicinal
point of view, it is cooling and emollient. In a calcined
state, it promotes the cicatrization of wounds, is very useful
as a desiccative, and is particularly good for pains in the head,
and for the detection of internal suppurations. If the earth,
when applied<a id="FNanchor_1896_1896"></a><a href="#Footnote_1896_1896" class="fnanchor">1896</a> with water, does not dry with rapidity, the

productions of the island of Topazus,<a id="FNanchor_1897_1897"></a><a href="#Footnote_1897_1897" class="fnanchor">1897</a> in the Red Sea; but
neither of them are imported to us from that place. The

<p>Atramentum,<a id="FNanchor_1903_1903"></a><a href="#Footnote_1903_1903" class="fnanchor">1903</a> too, must be reckoned among the artificial colours,
although it is also derived in two ways from the earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>For sometimes it is found exuding from the earth like the
brine of salt-pits, while at other times an earth itself of a
sulphurous colour is sought for the purpose. Painters, too, have
been known to go so far as to dig up half-charred bones<a id="FNanchor_1904_1904"></a><a href="#Footnote_1904_1904" class="fnanchor">1904</a> from
the sepulchres for this purpose.</p>

<p>All these plans, however, are new-fangled and troublesome;
for this substance may be prepared, in numerous ways, from
the soot that is yielded by the combustion of resin or pitch;
so much so, indeed, that manufactories have been built on the
principle of not allowing an escape for the smoke evolved by
the process. The most esteemed black,<a id="FNanchor_1905_1905"></a><a href="#Footnote_1905_1905" class="fnanchor">1905</a> however, that is made
in this way, is prepared from the wood of the torch-pine.</p>

<p>It is adulterated by mixing it with the ordinary soot from
furnaces and baths, a substance which is also employed for the
purpose of writing. Others, again, calcine dried wine-lees, and
assure us that if the wine was originally of good quality from
which the colour is made, it will bear comparison with that of
indicum.<a id="FNanchor_1906_1906"></a><a href="#Footnote_1906_1906" class="fnanchor">1906</a> Polygnotus and Micon, the most celebrated painters
of Athens, made their black from grape-husks, and called it
‚Äútryginon.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1907_1907"></a><a href="#Footnote_1907_1907" class="fnanchor">1907</a> Apelles invented a method of preparing it from
burnt ivory, the name given to it being ‚Äúelephantinon.‚Äù</p>

<p>We have indicum also, a substance imported from India, the
composition of which is at present unknown to me.<a id="FNanchor_1908_1908"></a><a href="#Footnote_1908_1908" class="fnanchor">1908</a> Dyers,
too, prepare an atramentum from the black inflorescence which
adheres to the brazen dye-pans. It is made also from logs of
torch-pine, burnt to charcoal and pounded in a mortar. The s√¶pia,
too, has a wonderful property of secreting a black liquid;<a id="FNanchor_1909_1909"></a><a href="#Footnote_1909_1909" class="fnanchor">1909</a>
but from this liquid no colour is prepared. The preparation of
every kind of atramentum is completed by exposure to the sun;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>the black, for writing, having an admixture of gum, and that
for coating walls, an admixture of glue. Black pigment that

CHAP. 26.‚ÄîPURPURISSUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>Among the remaining colours which, as already stated,<a id="FNanchor_1910_1910"></a><a href="#Footnote_1910_1910" class="fnanchor">1910</a>
owing to their dearness are furnished by the employer, purpurissum
holds the highest rank. For the purpose of preparing
it, argentaria or silver chalk<a id="FNanchor_1911_1911"></a><a href="#Footnote_1911_1911" class="fnanchor">1911</a> is dyed along with purple<a id="FNanchor_1912_1912"></a><a href="#Footnote_1912_1912" class="fnanchor">1912</a>
cloth, it imbibing the colour more speedily than the wool. The
best of all is that which, being thrown the very first into the
boiling cauldron, becomes saturated with the dye in its primitive
state. The next best in quality is that which has been
put into the same liquor, after the first has been removed.
Each time that this is done, the quality becomes proportionally
deteriorated, owing, of course, to the comparative thinness
of the liquid. The reason that the purpurissum of Puteoli
is more highly esteemed than that of Tyre, G√¶tulia, or Laconia,
places which produce the most precious kinds of purple, is the
fact that it combines more readily with hysginum,<a id="FNanchor_1913_1913"></a><a href="#Footnote_1913_1913" class="fnanchor">1913</a> and that
it is made to absorb the colouring liquid of madder. The
worst purpurissum is that of Lanuvium.<a id="FNanchor_1914_1914"></a><a href="#Footnote_1914_1914" class="fnanchor">1914</a></p>

<p>The price of purpurissum is from one to thirty denarii per
pound. Persons who use it in painting, place a coat of sandyx
beneath; a layer on which of purpurissum with glair of egg,
produces all the brilliant tints of minium. If, on the other
hand, it is their object to make a purple, they lay a coat of
c√¶ruleum<a id="FNanchor_1915_1915"></a><a href="#Footnote_1915_1915" class="fnanchor">1915</a> beneath, and purpurissum, with egg,<a id="FNanchor_1916_1916"></a><a href="#Footnote_1916_1916" class="fnanchor">1916</a> upon it.</p>

earth, or anularian<a id="FNanchor_1921_1921"></a><a href="#Footnote_1921_1921" class="fnanchor">1921</a> chalk with woad.</p>

<p>The proper way of testing indicum is by laying it on hot
coals, that which is genuine producing a fine purple flame,
and emitting a smell like that of sea-water while it smokes:
hence it is that some are of opinion that it is gathered from the
rocks on the sea-shore. The price of indicum is twenty denarii
per pound. Used medicinally, it alleviates cold shiverings
and defluxions, and acts as a desiccative upon sores.</p>

<p>Armenia sends us the colouring substance which is known
to us by its name.<a id="FNanchor_1922_1922"></a><a href="#Footnote_1922_1922" class="fnanchor">1922</a> This also is a mineral, which admits of
being dyed, like chrysocolla,<a id="FNanchor_1923_1923"></a><a href="#Footnote_1923_1923" class="fnanchor">1923</a> and is best when it most closely
resembles that substance, the colour being pretty much that of
c√¶ruleum. In former times it was sold at thirty sesterces per
pound; but there has been found of late in the Spanish
provinces a sand which admits of a similar preparation, and
consequently armenium has come to be sold so low as at six
denarii per pound. It differs from c√¶ruleum in a certain
degree of whiteness, which causes the colour it yields to be
thinner in comparison. The only use made of it in medicine
is for the purpose of giving nourishment to the hair, that of
the eyelids in particular.</p>

only contemplate this extensive variety of colours, we cannot

picture of high quality produced. Everything, in fact, was superior
at a time when the resources of art were so much fewer
than they now are. Yes, so it is; and the reason is, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>have already stated,<a id="FNanchor_1939_1939"></a><a href="#Footnote_1939_1939" class="fnanchor">1939</a> that it is the material, and not the efforts

CHAP. 33.‚ÄîAT WHAT TIME COMBATS OF GLADIATORS WERE FIRST
PAINTED AND PUBLICLY EXHIBITED.</span></h3></div>

<p>One folly, too, of this age of ours, in reference to painting, I
must not omit. The Emperor Nero ordered a painting of himself
to be executed upon canvass, of colossal proportions, one
hundred and twenty feet in height; a thing till then unknown.<a id="FNanchor_1940_1940"></a><a href="#Footnote_1940_1940" class="fnanchor">1940</a>
This picture was just completed when it was burnt
by lightning, with the greater part of the gardens of Maius,
in which it was exhibited.</p>

<p>A freedman of the same prince, on the occasion of his exhibiting
a show of gladiators at Antium, had the public porticos
hung, as everybody knows, with paintings, in which
were represented genuine portraits of the gladiators and all
the other assistants. Indeed, at this place, there has been a
very prevailing taste for paintings for many ages past. C.
Terentius Lucanus was the first who had combats of gladiators
painted for public exhibition: in honour of his grandfather,
who had adopted him, he provided thirty pairs of gladiators
in the Forum, for three consecutive days, and exhibited a
painting of their combats in the Grove of Diana.<a id="FNanchor_1941_1941"></a><a href="#Footnote_1941_1941" class="fnanchor">1941</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_34"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 34. (8.)‚ÄîTHE AGE OF PAINTING; WITH THE NAMES OF
THE MORE CELEBRATED WORKS AND ARTISTS, FOUR HUNDRED
AND FIVE IN NUMBER.</span></h3></div>

<p>I shall now proceed to enumerate, as briefly as possible, the
more eminent among the painters; it not being consistent with
the plan of this work to go into any great lengths of detail.
It must suffice therefore, in some cases, to name the artist in a
cursory manner only, and with reference to the account given of
others; with the exception, of course, of the more famous productions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>of the pictorial art, whether still in existence or
now lost, all of which it will be only right to take some notice
of. In this department, the ordinary exactness of the Greeks
has been somewhat inconsistent, in placing the painters so
many Olympiads after the statuaries and toreutic<a id="FNanchor_1942_1942"></a><a href="#Footnote_1942_1942" class="fnanchor">1942</a> artists, and
the very first of them so late as the ninetieth Olympiad; seeing
that Phidias himself is said to have been originally a painter,
and that there was a shield at Athens which had been painted
by him; in addition to which, it is universally agreed that in
the eighty-third Olympiad, his brother Pan√¶nus<a id="FNanchor_1943_1943"></a><a href="#Footnote_1943_1943" class="fnanchor">1943</a> painted, at
Elis,<a id="FNanchor_1944_1944"></a><a href="#Footnote_1944_1944" class="fnanchor">1944</a> the interior of the shield of Minerva, which had been
executed by Colotes,<a id="FNanchor_1945_1945"></a><a href="#Footnote_1945_1945" class="fnanchor">1945</a> a disciple of Phidias and his assistant
in the statue of the Olympian Jupiter.<a id="FNanchor_1946_1946"></a><a href="#Footnote_1946_1946" class="fnanchor">1946</a> And then besides, is it
not equally admitted that Candaules, the last Lydian king of the
race of the Heraclid√¶, very generally known also by the name
of Myrsilus, paid its weight in gold for a picture by the painter
Bularchus,<a id="FNanchor_1947_1947"></a><a href="#Footnote_1947_1947" class="fnanchor">1947</a> which represented the battle fought by him with
the Magnetes? so great was the estimation in which the art
was already held. This circumstance must of necessity have
happened about the period of our Romulus; for it was in the
eighteenth Olympiad that Candaules perished, or, as some
writers say, in the same year as the death of Romulus: a thing
which clearly demonstrates that even at that early period the
art had already become famous, and had arrived at a state of
great perfection.</p>

<p>If, then, we are bound to admit this conclusion, it must be
equally evident that the commencement of the art is of much
earlier date, and that those artists who painted in monochrome,<a id="FNanchor_1948_1948"></a><a href="#Footnote_1948_1948" class="fnanchor">1948</a>
and whose dates have not been handed down to us,
must have flourished at even an anterior period; Hygi√¶non,
namely, Dinias, Charmadas,<a id="FNanchor_1949_1949"></a><a href="#Footnote_1949_1949" class="fnanchor">1949</a> Eumarus, of Athens, the first who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>distinguished the sexes<a id="FNanchor_1950_1950"></a><a href="#Footnote_1950_1950" class="fnanchor">1950</a> in painting, and attempted to imitate
every kind of figure; and Cimon<a id="FNanchor_1951_1951"></a><a href="#Footnote_1951_1951" class="fnanchor">1951</a> of Cleon√¶, who improved
upon the inventions of Eumarus.</p>

<p>It was this Cimon, too, who first invented foreshortenings,<a id="FNanchor_1952_1952"></a><a href="#Footnote_1952_1952" class="fnanchor">1952</a>
or in other words, oblique views of the figure, and who first
learned to vary the features by representing them in the
various attitudes of looking backwards, upwards, or downwards.
It was he, too, who first marked the articulations of
the limbs, indicated the veins, and gave the natural folds and
sinuosities to drapery. Pan√¶nus, too, the brother of Phidias,
even executed a painting<a id="FNanchor_1953_1953"></a><a href="#Footnote_1953_1953" class="fnanchor">1953</a> of the battle fought by the Athenians
with the Persians at Marathon: so common, indeed, had
the employment of colours become, and to such a state of perfection
had the art arrived, that he was able to represent, it is
said, the portraits of the various generals who commanded at
that battle, Miltiades, Callimachus, and Cyn√¶girus, on the
side of the Athenians, and, on that of the barbarians, Datis
and Artaphernes.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_35"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 35. (9.)‚ÄîTHE FIRST CONTEST FOR EXCELLENCE IN THE
PICTORIAL ART.</span></h3></div>

<p>And not only this, but, during the time that Pan√¶nus
flourished, there were contests in the pictorial art instituted
at Corinth and Delphi. On the first occasion, Pan√¶nus himself
entered the lists, at the Pythian Games, with Timagoras
of Chalcis, by whom he was defeated; a circumstance which
is recorded in some ancient lines by Timagoras himself, and
an undoubted proof that the chroniclers are in error as to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>the date of the origin of painting. After these, and yet
before the ninetieth Olympiad, there were other celebrated
painters, Polygnotus of Thasos,<a id="FNanchor_1954_1954"></a><a href="#Footnote_1954_1954" class="fnanchor">1954</a> for instance, who was the
first to paint females in transparent drapery, and to represent
the head covered with a parti-coloured head-dress. He, too,
was the first to contribute many other improvements to the
art of painting, opening the mouth, for example, showing the
teeth, and throwing expression into the countenance, in place
of the ancient rigidity of the features.</p>

<p>There is a picture by this artist in the Portico<a id="FNanchor_1955_1955"></a><a href="#Footnote_1955_1955" class="fnanchor">1955</a> of Pompeius,
before the Curia that was built by him; with reference to
which, there is some doubt whether the man represented with
a shield is in the act of ascending or descending. He also
embellished the Temple<a id="FNanchor_1956_1956"></a><a href="#Footnote_1956_1956" class="fnanchor">1956</a> at Delphi, and at Athens the Portico
known as the P≈ìcile;<a id="FNanchor_1957_1957"></a><a href="#Footnote_1957_1957" class="fnanchor">1957</a> at which last he worked gratuitously,
in conjunction with Micon,<a id="FNanchor_1958_1958"></a><a href="#Footnote_1958_1958" class="fnanchor">1958</a> who received pay for his labours.
Indeed Polygnotus was held in the higher esteem of the two;
for the Amphictyons,<a id="FNanchor_1959_1959"></a><a href="#Footnote_1959_1959" class="fnanchor">1959</a> who form the general Council of Greece,
decreed that he should have his lodging furnished him at the
public expense.</p>

<p>There was also another Micon, distinguished from the first
Micon by the surname of ‚Äúthe younger,‚Äù and whose daughter
Timarete<a id="FNanchor_1960_1960"></a><a href="#Footnote_1960_1960" class="fnanchor">1960</a> also practised the art of painting.</p>

CHAP. 36.‚ÄîARTISTS WHO PAINTED WITH THE PENCIL.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the ninetieth Olympiad lived Aglaophon,<a id="FNanchor_1961_1961"></a><a href="#Footnote_1961_1961" class="fnanchor">1961</a> Cephisodorus,
Erillus, and Evenor, the father of Parrhasius, one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>greatest of painters, and of whom we shall have to speak
when we come to the period at which he flourished. All
these were artists of note, but not sufficiently so to detain us
by any further details, in our haste to arrive at the luminaries
of the art; first among whom shone Apollodorus of Athens,
in the ninety-third Olympiad. He was the first to paint
objects as they really appeared; the first too, we may justly
say, to confer glory<a id="FNanchor_1962_1962"></a><a href="#Footnote_1962_1962" class="fnanchor">1962</a> by the aid of the pencil.<a id="FNanchor_1963_1963"></a><a href="#Footnote_1963_1963" class="fnanchor">1963</a> Of this artist
there is a Priest in Adoration, and an Ajax struck by Lightning,
a work to be seen at Pergamus at the present day:
before him, there is no painting of any artist now to be seen
which has the power of rivetting the eye.</p>

<p>The gates of art being now thrown open by Apollodorus,
Zeuxis of Heraclea<a id="FNanchor_1964_1964"></a><a href="#Footnote_1964_1964" class="fnanchor">1964</a> entered upon the scene, in the fourth year
of the ninety-fifth Olympiad, destined to lead the pencil‚Äîfor
it is of the pencil that we are still speaking‚Äîa pencil for
which there was nothing too arduous, to a very high pitch of
glory. By some writers he is erroneously placed in the
eighty-ninth Olympiad, a date that must of necessity be reserved
for Demophilus of Himera and Neseus of Thasos, of
one of whom, it is uncertain which, Zeuxis was the pupil.
It was in reference to him that Apollodorus, above-mentioned,
wrote a verse to the effect, that Zeuxis had stolen the art
from others and had taken it all to himself.<a id="FNanchor_1965_1965"></a><a href="#Footnote_1965_1965" class="fnanchor">1965</a> Zeuxis also
acquired such a vast amount of wealth, that, in a spirit of
ostentation, he went so far as to parade himself at Olympia
with his name embroidered on the checked pattern of his
garments in letters of gold. At a later period, he came to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>determination to give away his works, there being no price
high enough to pay for them, he said. Thus, for instance,
he gave an Alcmena to the people of Agrigentum, and a Pan
to Archela√ºs.<a id="FNanchor_1966_1966"></a><a href="#Footnote_1966_1966" class="fnanchor">1966</a> He also painted a Penelope, in which the
peculiar character of that matron appears to be delineated to
the very life; and a figure of an athlete, with which he was
so highly pleased, that he wrote beneath it the line which has
since become so famous, to the effect that it would be easier
to find fault with him than to imitate him.<a id="FNanchor_1967_1967"></a><a href="#Footnote_1967_1967" class="fnanchor">1967</a> His Jupiter
seated on the throne, with the other Deities standing around
him, is a magnificent production: the same, too, with his
Infant Hercules strangling the Dragons, in presence of Amphitryon
and his mother Alcmena, who is struck with horror.
Still, however, Zeuxis is generally censured for making the
heads and articulations of his figures out of proportion. And
yet, so scrupulously careful was he, that on one occasion, when
he was about to execute a painting for the people of Agrigentum,<a id="FNanchor_1968_1968"></a><a href="#Footnote_1968_1968" class="fnanchor">1968</a>
to be consecrated in the Temple of the Lacinian
Juno there, he had the young maidens of the place stripped
for examination, and selected five of them, in order to adopt
in his picture the most commendable points in the form of
each. He also painted some monochromes in white.<a id="FNanchor_1969_1969"></a><a href="#Footnote_1969_1969" class="fnanchor">1969</a></p>

<p>The contemporaries and rivals of Zeuxis were Timanthes,
Androcydes, Eupompus, and Parrhasius. (10.) This last, it
is said, entered into a pictorial contest with Zeuxis, who
represented some grapes, painted so naturally that the birds
flew towards the spot where the picture was exhibited.
Parrhasius, on the other hand, exhibited a curtain, drawn with
such singular truthfulness, that Zeuxis, elated with the
judgment which had been passed upon his work by the birds,
haughtily demanded that the curtain should be drawn aside to
let the picture be seen. Upon finding his mistake, with a great
degree of ingenuous candour he admitted that he had been
surpassed, for that whereas he himself had only deceived the
birds, Parrhasius had deceived him, an artist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>There is a story, too, that at a later period, Zeuxis having
painted a child carrying grapes, the birds came to peck at them;
upon which, with a similar degree of candour, he expressed
himself vexed with his work, and exclaimed‚Äî‚ÄúI have surely
painted the grapes better than the child, for if I had fully
succeeded in the last, the birds would have been in fear of
it.‚Äù Zeuxis executed some figures also in clay,<a id="FNanchor_1970_1970"></a><a href="#Footnote_1970_1970" class="fnanchor">1970</a> the only
works of art that were left behind at Ambracia, when Fulvius
Nobilior<a id="FNanchor_1971_1971"></a><a href="#Footnote_1971_1971" class="fnanchor">1971</a> transported the Muses from that city to Rome. There
is at Rome a Helena by Zeuxis, in the Porticos of Philippus,<a id="FNanchor_1972_1972"></a><a href="#Footnote_1972_1972" class="fnanchor">1972</a>
and a Marsyas Bound, in the Temple of Concord<a id="FNanchor_1973_1973"></a><a href="#Footnote_1973_1973" class="fnanchor">1973</a> there.</p>

<p>Parrhasius of Ephesus also contributed greatly to the progress
of painting, being the first to give symmetry to his
figures, the first to give play and expression to the features,
elegance to the hair, and gracefulness to the mouth: indeed,
for contour, it is universally admitted by artists that he bore
away the palm. This, in painting, is the very highest point
of skill. To paint substantial bodies and the interior of
objects is a great thing, no doubt, but at the same time it is a
point in which many have excelled: but to make the extreme
outline of the figure, to give the finishing touches to the
painting in rounding off the contour, this is a point of success
in the art which is but rarely attained. For the extreme
outline, to be properly executed, requires to be nicely rounded,
and so to terminate as to prove the existence of something
more behind it, and thereby disclose that which it also serves
to hide.</p>

<p>Such is the merit conceded to Parrhasius by Antigonus<a id="FNanchor_1974_1974"></a><a href="#Footnote_1974_1974" class="fnanchor">1974</a>
and Xenocrates,<a id="FNanchor_1975_1975"></a><a href="#Footnote_1975_1975" class="fnanchor">1975</a> who have written on the art of painting;
and in this as well as in other points, not only do they admit
his excellence, but enlarge upon it in terms of the highest
commendation. There are many pen sketches by him still in
existence, both upon panel and on parchment, from the study
of which, even artists, it is said, may greatly profit.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these points of excellence, however, Parrhasius
seems comparatively inferior to himself in giving the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>proper expression to the middle of the body. In his allegorical
picture of the People of Athens, he has displayed
singular ingenuity in the treatment of his subject; for in
representing it, he had to depict it as at once fickle, choleric,
unjust, and versatile; while, again, he had equally to show its
attributes of implacability<a id="FNanchor_1976_1976"></a><a href="#Footnote_1976_1976" class="fnanchor">1976</a> and clemency, compassionateness
and pride, loftiness and humility, fierceness and timidity‚Äîand
all these at once. He painted a Theseus also, which was
formerly in the Capitol at Rome, a Naval Commander<a id="FNanchor_1977_1977"></a><a href="#Footnote_1977_1977" class="fnanchor">1977</a> wearing
a cuirass, and, in one picture, now at Rhodes, figures of
Meleager, Hercules, and Perseus. This last painting, though
it has been thrice struck by lightning, has escaped being
effaced, a circumstance which tends to augment the admiration
which it naturally excites. He painted an Archigallus<a id="FNanchor_1978_1978"></a><a href="#Footnote_1978_1978" class="fnanchor">1978</a>
also, a picture which the Emperor Tiberius greatly
admired. According to Deculo,<a id="FNanchor_1979_1979"></a><a href="#Footnote_1979_1979" class="fnanchor">1979</a> that prince had it shut up in
his chamber, the price at which it was valued being six
hundred thousand sesterces.</p>

<p>Parrhasius also painted a Thracian Nurse, with an Infant
in her arms, a Philiscus,<a id="FNanchor_1980_1980"></a><a href="#Footnote_1980_1980" class="fnanchor">1980</a> a Father Liber<a id="FNanchor_1981_1981"></a><a href="#Footnote_1981_1981" class="fnanchor">1981</a> attended by Virtue,
Two Children, in which we see pourtrayed the careless simplicity
of childhood, and a Priest attended by a Boy, with a
censer and chaplet. There are also two most noble pictures
by him; one of which represents a Runner<a id="FNanchor_1982_1982"></a><a href="#Footnote_1982_1982" class="fnanchor">1982</a> contending for the
prize, completely armed, so naturally depicted that he has all
the appearance of sweating. In the other we see the Runner
taking off his armour, and can fancy that we hear him panting
aloud for breath. His √Üneas, Castor, and Pollux, all represented
in the same picture, are highly praised; his Telephus also,
and his Achilles, Agamemnon, and Ulysses.</p>

<p>Parrhasius was a most prolific artist, but at the same time
there was no one who enjoyed the glory conferred upon him by
his talent with greater insolence and arrogance. It was in this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>spirit, that he went so far as to assume certain surnames, and
to call himself ‚ÄúHabrodi√¶tus;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_1983_1983"></a><a href="#Footnote_1983_1983" class="fnanchor">1983</a> while in some other verses
he declared himself to be the ‚Äúprince of painters,‚Äù and asserted
that in him the art had arrived at perfection. But above all
things, it was a boast with him that he had sprung from the
lineage of Apollo, and that he had painted his Hercules, a
picture now at Lindos, just as he had often seen him in his
sleep. It was in this spirit, too, that upon being defeated by
Timanthes, at Samos, by a great majority of votes, the subject
of the picture being Ajax and the Award of the Arms,<a id="FNanchor_1984_1984"></a><a href="#Footnote_1984_1984" class="fnanchor">1984</a> he
declared, in the name of his hero, that he felt himself quite
disgraced on thus seeing himself a second time defeated by an
unworthy opponent. He painted also some smaller pictures of
an immodest nature, indulging his leisure in such prurient
fancies as these.<a id="FNanchor_1985_1985"></a><a href="#Footnote_1985_1985" class="fnanchor">1985</a></p>

<p>As to Timanthes,<a id="FNanchor_1986_1986"></a><a href="#Footnote_1986_1986" class="fnanchor">1986</a> he was an artist highly gifted with
genius, and loud have some of the orators<a id="FNanchor_1987_1987"></a><a href="#Footnote_1987_1987" class="fnanchor">1987</a> been in their commendations
of his Iphigenia, represented as she stands at the
altar awaiting her doom. Upon the countenance of all present,
that of her uncle<a id="FNanchor_1988_1988"></a><a href="#Footnote_1988_1988" class="fnanchor">1988</a> in particular, grief was depicted; but
having already exhausted all the characteristic features of
sorrow, the artist adopted the device of veiling the features
of the victim‚Äôs father,<a id="FNanchor_1989_1989"></a><a href="#Footnote_1989_1989" class="fnanchor">1989</a> finding himself unable adequately to
give expression to his feelings. There are also some other
proofs of his genius, a Sleeping Cyclops, for instance, which he
has painted upon a small panel; but, being desirous to convey an
idea of his gigantic stature, he has painted some Satyrs near
him measuring his thumb with a thyrsus. Indeed, Timanthes
is the only one among the artists in whose works there is
always something more implied by the pencil than is expressed,
and whose execution, though of the very highest quality, is
always surpassed by the inventiveness of his genius. He has
also painted the figure of a Hero, a master-piece of skill, in
which he has carried the art to the very highest pitch of perfection,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>in the delineation of the warrior: this last-mentioned
work is now at Rome, in the Temple of Pence.<a id="FNanchor_1990_1990"></a><a href="#Footnote_1990_1990" class="fnanchor">1990</a></p>

<p>It was at this period, too, that Euxinidas had for his pupil
Aristides,<a id="FNanchor_1991_1991"></a><a href="#Footnote_1991_1991" class="fnanchor">1991</a> who became a most illustrious artist; and that
Eupompus instructed Pamphilus, who afterwards became the
instructor of Apelles. There is by Eupompus, a Victor in a
gymnastic contest, holding a palm. So high was the reputation
of this artist, that he established a school of painting, and
so divided the art into three styles; whereas till then there had
been but two, known respectively as the Helladic<a id="FNanchor_1992_1992"></a><a href="#Footnote_1992_1992" class="fnanchor">1992</a> and the
Asiatic. In honour of him, a native of Sicyon by birth, the
Helladic school was divided into two, and from this period
there were three distinct styles recognized, the Ionic, the
Sicyonian, and the Attic.</p>

<p>We have, by Pamphilus,<a id="FNanchor_1993_1993"></a><a href="#Footnote_1993_1993" class="fnanchor">1993</a> a picture representing the Alliance
and the Battle that was fought at Phlius;<a id="FNanchor_1994_1994"></a><a href="#Footnote_1994_1994" class="fnanchor">1994</a> the Victory<a id="FNanchor_1995_1995"></a><a href="#Footnote_1995_1995" class="fnanchor">1995</a> also
that was gained by the Athenians, and a representation of
Ulysses in his ship. He was a Macedonian by birth, but was
the first painter who was also skilled in all the other sciences,
arithmetic and geometry more particularly, without the aid of
which he maintained that the pictorial art could not attain
perfection. He gave instruction to no one for a smaller sum
than one talent, at the rate of five hundred denarii per
annum,<a id="FNanchor_1996_1996"></a><a href="#Footnote_1996_1996" class="fnanchor">1996</a> and this fee both Apelles and Melanthius paid. It
was through his influence that, first at Sicyon, and then
throughout the whole of Greece, all children of free birth were
taught the graphic<a id="FNanchor_1997_1997"></a><a href="#Footnote_1997_1997" class="fnanchor">1997</a> art, or in other words, the art of depicting
upon boxwood, before all others; in consequence of which this
came to be looked upon as the first step in the liberal arts. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>is the fact, however, that this art has always been held in high
estimation, and cultivated by persons of free birth, and that, at a
more recent period, men of rank even began to pursue it; it
having always been forbidden that slaves should receive instruction
in it. Hence it is, that neither in painting nor in the
toreutic<a id="FNanchor_1998_1998"></a><a href="#Footnote_1998_1998" class="fnanchor">1998</a> art has there been any celebrated work executed by
a slave.</p>

<p>In the hundred and seventh Olympiad, flourished A√´tion and
Therimachus.<a id="FNanchor_1999_1999"></a><a href="#Footnote_1999_1999" class="fnanchor">1999</a> By the former we have some fine pictures; a
Father Liber,<a id="FNanchor_2000_2000"></a><a href="#Footnote_2000_2000" class="fnanchor">2000</a> Tragedy and Comedy, Semiramis from the rank
of a slave elevated to the throne, an Old Woman bearing
torches, and a New-made Bride, remarkable for the air of
modesty with which she is pourtrayed.</p>

<p>But it was Apelles<a id="FNanchor_2001_2001"></a><a href="#Footnote_2001_2001" class="fnanchor">2001</a> of Cos, in the hundred and twelfth
Olympiad, who surpassed all the other painters who either
preceded or succeeded him. Single-handed, he contributed
more to painting than all the others together, and even went
so far as to publish some treatises on the principles of the art.
The great point of artistic merit with him was his singular charm
of gracefulness,<a id="FNanchor_2002_2002"></a><a href="#Footnote_2002_2002" class="fnanchor">2002</a> and this too, though the greatest of painters
were his contemporaries. In admiring their works and bestowing
high eulogiums upon them, he used to say that there
was still wanting in them that ideal of beauty<a id="FNanchor_2003_2003"></a><a href="#Footnote_2003_2003" class="fnanchor">2003</a> so peculiar to
himself, and known to the Greeks as ‚ÄúCharis;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2004_2004"></a><a href="#Footnote_2004_2004" class="fnanchor">2004</a> others, he said,
had acquired all the other requisites of perfection, but in this one
point he himself had no equal. He also asserted his claim to
another great point of merit: admiring a picture by Protogenes,
which bore evident marks of unbounded laboriousness and the
most minute finish, he remarked that in every respect Protogenes
was fully his equal, or perhaps his superior, except in
this, that he himself knew when to take his hand off a
picture‚Äîa memorable lesson, which teaches us that overcarefulness
may be productive of bad results. His candour
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>too, was equal to his talent; he acknowledged the superiority
of Melanthius in his grouping, and of Asclepiodorus in the
niceness of his measurements, or, in other words, the distances
that ought to be left between the objects represented.</p>

<p>A circumstance that happened to him in connection with
Protogenes is worthy of notice. The latter was living at Rhodes,
when Apelles disembarked there, desirous of seeing the works
of a man whom he had hitherto only known by reputation.
Accordingly, he repaired at once to the studio; Protogenes
was not at home, but there happened to be a large panel
upon the easel ready for painting, with an old woman who
was left in charge. To his enquiries she made answer, that
Protogenes was not at home, and then asked whom she
should name as the visitor. ‚ÄúHere he is,‚Äù was the reply of
Apelles, and seizing a brush, he traced with colour upon the
panel an outline of a singularly minute fineness. Upon his
return, the old woman mentioned to Protogenes what had
happened. The artist, it is said, upon remarking the delicacy
of the touch, instantly exclaimed that Apelles must have been
the visitor, for that no other person was capable of executing
anything so exquisitely perfect. So saying, he traced within
the same outline a still finer outline, but with another colour,
and then took his departure, with instructions to the woman
to show it to the stranger, if he returned, and to let him know
that this was the person whom he had come to see. It happened
as he anticipated; Apelles returned, and vexed at finding
himself thus surpassed, he took up another colour and split<a id="FNanchor_2005_2005"></a><a href="#Footnote_2005_2005" class="fnanchor">2005</a>
both of the outlines, leaving no possibility of anything finer being
executed. Upon seeing this, Protogenes admitted that he was
defeated, and at once flew to the harbour to look for his guest.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>He thought proper, too, to transmit the panel to posterity, just
as it was, and it always continued to be held in the highest
admiration by all, artists in particular. I am told that it was
burnt in the first fire which took place at C√¶sar‚Äôs palace on
the Palatine Hill; but in former times I have often stopped
to admire it. Upon its vast surface it contained nothing
whatever except the three outlines, so remarkably fine as to
escape the sight: among the most elaborate works of numerous
other artists it had all the appearance of a blank space; and
yet by that very fact it attracted the notice of every one, and
was held in higher estimation than any other painting there.</p>

<p>It was a custom with Apelles, to which he most tenaciously
adhered, never to let any day pass, however busy he might be,
without exercising himself by tracing some outline or other; a
practice which has now passed into a proverb.<a id="FNanchor_2006_2006"></a><a href="#Footnote_2006_2006" class="fnanchor">2006</a> It was also
a practice with him, when he had completed a work, to exhibit
it to the view of the passers-by in some exposed place;<a id="FNanchor_2007_2007"></a><a href="#Footnote_2007_2007" class="fnanchor">2007</a> while
he himself, concealed behind the picture, would listen to the
criticisms that were passed upon it; it being his opinion that
the judgment of the public was preferable to his own, as being
the more discerning of the two. It was under these circumstances,
they say, that he was censured by a shoemaker for
having represented the shoes with one shoe-string too little.
The next day, the shoemaker, quite proud at seeing the former
error corrected, thanks to his advice, began to criticize the
leg; upon which Apelles, full of indignation, popped his head
out, and reminded him that a shoemaker should give no opinion
beyond the shoes, a piece of advice which has equally passed into
a proverbial saying.<a id="FNanchor_2008_2008"></a><a href="#Footnote_2008_2008" class="fnanchor">2008</a> In fact, Apelles was a person of great
amenity of manners, a circumstance which rendered him particularly
agreeable to Alexander the Great, who would often
come to his studio. He had forbidden himself, by public edict,
as already stated,<a id="FNanchor_2009_2009"></a><a href="#Footnote_2009_2009" class="fnanchor">2009</a> to be represented by any other artist. On
one occasion, however, when the prince was in his studio,
talking a great deal about painting without knowing anything
about it, Apelles quietly begged that he would quit the subject,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>telling him that he would get laughed at by the boys who
were there grinding the colours: so great was the influence
which he rightfully possessed over a monarch, who was otherwise
of an irascible temperament. And yet, irascible as he was,
Alexander conferred upon him a very signal mark of the high
estimation in which he held him; for having, in his admiration
of her extraordinary beauty, engaged Apelles to paint
Pancaste undraped,<a id="FNanchor_2010_2010"></a><a href="#Footnote_2010_2010" class="fnanchor">2010</a> the most beloved of all his concubines,
the artist while so engaged, fell in love with her; upon which,
Alexander, perceiving this to be the case, made him a present
of her, thus showing himself, though a great king in courage,
a still greater one in self-command, this action redounding no
less to his honour than any of his victories. For in thus conquering
himself, not only did he sacrifice his passions in
favour of the artist, but even his affections as well; uninfluenced,
too, by the feelings which must have possessed his favourite
in thus passing at once from the arms of a monarch to
those of a painter. Some persons are of opinion that Pancaste
was the model of Apelles in his painting of Venus Anadyomene.<a id="FNanchor_2011_2011"></a><a href="#Footnote_2011_2011" class="fnanchor">2011</a></p>

<p>It was Apelles too, who, courteous even to his rivals, first
established the reputation of Protogenes at Rhodes. Held as
he was in little estimation by his own fellow-countrymen,
a thing that generally<a id="FNanchor_2012_2012"></a><a href="#Footnote_2012_2012" class="fnanchor">2012</a> is the case, Apelles enquired of him
what price he set upon certain finished works of his, which
he had on hand. Upon Protogenes mentioning some very
trifling sum or other, Apelles made him an offer of fifty talents,
and then circulated a report that he was buying these works
in order to sell them as his own. By this contrivance, he
aroused the Rhodians to a better appreciation of the merits
of their artist, and only consented to leave the pictures with
them upon their offering a still larger price.</p>

<p>He painted portraits, too, so exactly to the life, that a fact
with which we are made acquainted by the writings of Apion
the grammarian seems altogether incredible. One of those
persons, he says, who divine events by the traits of the features,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>and are known as ‚Äúmetoposcopi,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2013_2013"></a><a href="#Footnote_2013_2013" class="fnanchor">2013</a> was enabled, by an
examination of his portraits, to tell the year of their death,
whether past or future, of each person represented. Apelles
had been on bad terms with Ptolem√¶us in former times, when
they formed part of the suite of Alexander. After Ptolem√¶us
had become king of Egypt, it so happened that Apelles was
driven by the violence of a tempest to Alexandria. Upon this,
some of his rivals fraudulently suborned a jester, who was attached
to the court, to carry him an invitation to dine with the
king. Accordingly, Apelles attended; upon which Ptolem√¶us
was highly indignant, and, summoning before him his stewards<a id="FNanchor_2014_2014"></a><a href="#Footnote_2014_2014" class="fnanchor">2014</a>
of the household, requested that the artist would point out the
one that had given him the invitation. Thus challenged,
Apelles seized a piece of quenched charcoal that lay in the
fire-place, and traced a likeness upon the wall, with such exactness,
that the king, the moment he began it, recognized the
features as those of the jester. He also painted a portrait of
King Antigonus;<a id="FNanchor_2015_2015"></a><a href="#Footnote_2015_2015" class="fnanchor">2015</a> and as that monarch was blind of one eye, he
invented a method of concealing the defect. With this object,
he painted him in profile, in order that what in reality was
wanting to the person might have the semblance of being
wanting to the picture rather, he making it his care to show
that side of the face only which he could show without any
defect. Among his works, too, there are some figures representing
persons at the point of death; but it is not easy to say
which of his productions are of the highest order of excellence.</p>

<p>His Venus Rising from the Sea, known as the Venus Anadyomene,<a id="FNanchor_2016_2016"></a><a href="#Footnote_2016_2016" class="fnanchor">2016</a>
was consecrated by the late Emperor Augustus in the
Temple<a id="FNanchor_2017_2017"></a><a href="#Footnote_2017_2017" class="fnanchor">2017</a> of his father<a id="FNanchor_2018_2018"></a><a href="#Footnote_2018_2018" class="fnanchor">2018</a> C√¶sar; a work which has been celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>in certain Greek lines,<a id="FNanchor_2019_2019"></a><a href="#Footnote_2019_2019" class="fnanchor">2019</a> which, though they have outlived
it, have perpetuated its fame.<a id="FNanchor_2020_2020"></a><a href="#Footnote_2020_2020" class="fnanchor">2020</a> The lower part of the
picture having become damaged, no one could be found to
repair it; and thus did the very injury which the picture had
sustained, redound to the glory of the artist. Time, however,
and damp at last effaced the painting, and Nero, in his reign,
had it replaced by a copy, painted by the hand of Dorotheus.<a id="FNanchor_2021_2021"></a><a href="#Footnote_2021_2021" class="fnanchor">2021</a>
Apelles also commenced another Venus for the people of Cos,<a id="FNanchor_2022_2022"></a><a href="#Footnote_2022_2022" class="fnanchor">2022</a>
which would have outshone even the former one; but death
invidiously prevented its completion, nor could any one be
found to complete the work in conformity with the sketches of
the outline. He painted also, in the Temple of Diana at
Ephesus, Alexander the Great wielding the Thunderbolts, a
picture for which he received twenty talents of gold. The
fingers have all the appearance of projecting from the surface,
and the lightning seems to be darting from the picture.
And then, too, let the reader bear in mind that all these works
were executed by the aid of four<a id="FNanchor_2023_2023"></a><a href="#Footnote_2023_2023" class="fnanchor">2023</a> colours only. The price
paid in golden coin for this picture was ascertained by weight,<a id="FNanchor_2024_2024"></a><a href="#Footnote_2024_2024" class="fnanchor">2024</a>
there being no specific sum agreed upon.</p>

<p>He also painted a Procession of the Megabyzus,<a id="FNanchor_2025_2025"></a><a href="#Footnote_2025_2025" class="fnanchor">2025</a> the priest
of Diana at Ephesus; and a Clitus<a id="FNanchor_2026_2026"></a><a href="#Footnote_2026_2026" class="fnanchor">2026</a> on Horseback, hastening
to the combat, his Armour-bearer handing him his helmet
at his command. How many times he painted Alexander and
Philip, it would be quite superfluous to attempt to enumerate.
At Samos, there is a Habron<a id="FNanchor_2027_2027"></a><a href="#Footnote_2027_2027" class="fnanchor">2027</a> by him, that is greatly admired;
at Rhodes a Menander,<a id="FNanchor_2028_2028"></a><a href="#Footnote_2028_2028" class="fnanchor">2028</a> king of Caria, and an Anc√¶us;<a id="FNanchor_2029_2029"></a><a href="#Footnote_2029_2029" class="fnanchor">2029</a> at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>Alexandria, a Gorgosthenes, the Tragedian; and at Rome, a Castor
and Pollux, with figures of Victory and Alexander the Great,
and an emblematical figure of War with her hands tied behind
her, and Alexander seated in a triumphal car; both of
which pictures the late Emperor Augustus, with a great degree
of moderation<a id="FNanchor_2030_2030"></a><a href="#Footnote_2030_2030" class="fnanchor">2030</a> and good taste, consecrated in the most frequented
parts of his Forum: the Emperor Claudius, however,
thought it advisable to efface the head of Alexander in both
pictures, and substitute likenesses of his predecessor Augustus.
It is by his hand too, it is generally supposed, that the Hercules,
with the face averted, now in the Temple of Anna,<a id="FNanchor_2031_2031"></a><a href="#Footnote_2031_2031" class="fnanchor">2031</a> was
painted; a picture in which, one of the greatest difficulties in
the art, the face, though hidden, may be said to be seen rather
than left to the imagination. He also painted a figure of a
naked<a id="FNanchor_2032_2032"></a><a href="#Footnote_2032_2032" class="fnanchor">2032</a> Hero,<a id="FNanchor_2033_2033"></a><a href="#Footnote_2033_2033" class="fnanchor">2033</a> a picture in which he has challenged Nature
herself.</p>

<p>There exists too, or did exist, a Horse that was painted by
him for a pictorial contest; as to the merits of which, Apelles
appealed from the judgment of his fellow-men to that of the
dumb quadrupeds. For, finding that by their intrigues his
rivals were likely to get the better of him, he had some horses
brought, and the picture of each artist successively shown to
them. Accordingly, it was only at the sight of the horse
painted by Apelles that they began to neigh; a thing that has
always been the case since, whenever this test of his artistic
skill has been employed. He also painted a Neoptolemus<a id="FNanchor_2034_2034"></a><a href="#Footnote_2034_2034" class="fnanchor">2034</a> on
horse-back, fighting with the Persians; an Archel√§us,<a id="FNanchor_2035_2035"></a><a href="#Footnote_2035_2035" class="fnanchor">2035</a> with
his Wife and Daughter; and an Antigonus on foot, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>cuirass on, and his horse led by his side. Connoisseurs in the
art give the preference, before all other works of his, to his
paintings of King Archel√§us on horseback, and of Diana
in the midst of a throng of Virgins performing a sacrifice;
a work in which he would appear to have surpassed
the lines<a id="FNanchor_2036_2036"></a><a href="#Footnote_2036_2036" class="fnanchor">2036</a> of Homer descriptive of the same subject. He
also portrayed some things, which in reality do not admit
of being portrayed‚Äîthunder, lightning, and thunderbolts, in
pictures which are known by the respective names of Bronte,
Astrape, and Ceraunobolia.</p>

<p>His inventions, too, in the art of painting, have been highly
serviceable to others; but one thing there was in which no one
could imitate him. When his works were finished, he used to
cover them with a black varnish, of such remarkable thinness,
that while by the reflection it gave more vivacity to the colours,
and preserved them from the contact of dust and dirt, its
existence could only be detected by a person when close enough
to touch it.<a id="FNanchor_2037_2037"></a><a href="#Footnote_2037_2037" class="fnanchor">2037</a> In addition to this, there was also this other
great advantage attending it: the brightness of the colours
was softened thereby, and harmonized to the sight, looking as
though they had been viewed from a distance, and through a
medium of specular-stone;<a id="FNanchor_2038_2038"></a><a href="#Footnote_2038_2038" class="fnanchor">2038</a> the contrivance, by some indescribable
means, giving a sombreness to colours which would otherwise
have been too florid.</p>

<p>One of the contemporaries of Apelles was Aristides<a id="FNanchor_2039_2039"></a><a href="#Footnote_2039_2039" class="fnanchor">2039</a> of
Thebes; the first of all the painters to give full expression to
the mind<a id="FNanchor_2040_2040"></a><a href="#Footnote_2040_2040" class="fnanchor">2040</a> and passions of man, known to the Greeks as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">·º§Œ∏Œ∑</span>,
as well as to the mental perturbations which we experience:
he was somewhat harsh, however, in his colours. There is a
picture by him of a Captured City, in which is represented an
infant crawling toward the breast of its wounded mother, who,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>though at the point of death, has all the appearance of being
aware of it, and of being in dread lest the child should suck
blood in place of milk from her exhausted breast: this picture
Alexander the Great ordered to be transferred to Pella, his
native place. Aristides also painted a Battle with the Persians,
a picture which contained one hundred figures, for each
of which he was paid at the rate of ten min√¶ by Mnason, the
tyrant of Elatea.<a id="FNanchor_2041_2041"></a><a href="#Footnote_2041_2041" class="fnanchor">2041</a> He also painted Chariots with four horses
in full career; a Suppliant, which almost speaks, Huntsmen
with game; Leontion, the mistress of Epicurus; the Anapauomene,<a id="FNanchor_2042_2042"></a><a href="#Footnote_2042_2042" class="fnanchor">2042</a>
a damsel pining to death from love for her brother;
a Father Liber<a id="FNanchor_2043_2043"></a><a href="#Footnote_2043_2043" class="fnanchor">2043</a> also, and an Artamene, two fine pictures now
to be seen in the Temple of Ceres<a id="FNanchor_2044_2044"></a><a href="#Footnote_2044_2044" class="fnanchor">2044</a> at Rome; a Tragedian and
a Child, in the Temple of Apollo,<a id="FNanchor_2045_2045"></a><a href="#Footnote_2045_2045" class="fnanchor">2045</a> a picture which has lost its
beauty, owing to the unskilfulness of the painter to whom M.
Junius, the pr√¶tor, entrusted the cleaning of it, about the
period of the Apollinarian Games.<a id="FNanchor_2046_2046"></a><a href="#Footnote_2046_2046" class="fnanchor">2046</a> There was also to be
seen, in the Temple of Faith, in the Capitol, a picture of his,
representing an Aged Man giving instructions to a Child on
the lyre. He executed also a painting of an Invalid, upon
which endless encomiums have been lavished. Indeed, so great
was the excellence of this artist, that King Attalus, it is said,
purchased one picture of his at the price of one hundred
talents.</p>

<p>At the same period<a id="FNanchor_2047_2047"></a><a href="#Footnote_2047_2047" class="fnanchor">2047</a> flourished Protogenes, as already stated.
He was a native of Caunus,<a id="FNanchor_2048_2048"></a><a href="#Footnote_2048_2048" class="fnanchor">2048</a> a place held in subjection by the
Rhodians. Great poverty in his early days, and extreme
application to his art, were the causes of his comparative unproductiveness.
It is not known with certainty from whom
he received his instruction in the art: indeed some say that he
was only a ship-decorator down to his fiftieth year; a proof of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>which, it is asserted, is the fact, that in decorating the Propyl√¶um<a id="FNanchor_2049_2049"></a><a href="#Footnote_2049_2049" class="fnanchor">2049</a>
of the Temple of Minerva, situate in one of the most
celebrated spots in Athens, where he has painted the fine picture<a id="FNanchor_2050_2050"></a><a href="#Footnote_2050_2050" class="fnanchor">2050</a>
of Paralus and Hammonias, known by some as the
Nausicaa, he has added in the side pieces of the picture, by
painters called ‚Äúparerga,‚Äù several small ships of war;<a id="FNanchor_2051_2051"></a><a href="#Footnote_2051_2051" class="fnanchor">2051</a> wishing
thereby to show in what department that skill had first
manifested itself which had thus reached the citadel of Athens,
the scene of his glory. Of all his compositions, however, the
palm has been awarded to his Ialysus,<a id="FNanchor_2052_2052"></a><a href="#Footnote_2052_2052" class="fnanchor">2052</a> now at Rome, consecrated
in the Temple of Peace there. So long as he was at
work upon it, he lived, it is said, upon nothing but soaked
lupines; by which means he at once appeased both hunger and
thirst, and avoided all risk of blunting his perception by too
delicate a diet. In order to protect this picture against the effects
of ill-usage and old age, he painted it over four times,<a id="FNanchor_2053_2053"></a><a href="#Footnote_2053_2053" class="fnanchor">2053</a> so that
when an upper coat might fail, there would be an under one to
succeed it. There is in this picture the figure of a dog,
which was completed in a very remarkable manner, inasmuch
as accident had an equal share with design in the execution of
it. The painter was of opinion that he had not given the
proper expression to the foam at the mouth of the animal,
panting for breath, as it was represented; while, with all
other parts of the picture, a thing extremely difficult with him,
he was perfectly satisfied. The thing that displeased him was,
the evident traces of art in the execution of it, touches which
did not admit of any diminution, and yet had all the appearance
of being too laboured, the effect produced being far removed
from his conception of the reality: the foam, in fact,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>bore the marks of being painted, and not of being the natural
secretion of the animal‚Äôs mouth. Vexed and tormented
by this dilemma, it being his wish to depict truth itself, and
not something that only bore a semblance of truth, he effaced
it again and again, changed his pencil for another, and yet by
no possibility could satisfy himself. At last, quite out of temper
with an art, which, in spite of him, would still obtrude
itself, he dashed his sponge against the vexatious spot; when
behold! the sponge replaced the colours that it had just removed,
exactly in accordance with his utmost wishes, and thus did
chance represent Nature in a painting.</p>

<p>Following his example, Nealces,<a id="FNanchor_2054_2054"></a><a href="#Footnote_2054_2054" class="fnanchor">2054</a> it is said, succeeded in
representing the foam at a horse‚Äôs mouth; for on one occasion,
when engaged in painting a man holding in a pair of horses
and soothing them with his voice,<a id="FNanchor_2055_2055"></a><a href="#Footnote_2055_2055" class="fnanchor">2055</a> he also dashed his sponge
against the picture, with the view of producing a like effect.</p>

<p>It was on account of this Ialysus, which he was apprehensive
of destroying, that King Demetrius<a id="FNanchor_2056_2056"></a><a href="#Footnote_2056_2056" class="fnanchor">2056</a> forbore to set fire to
the only side of the city of Rhodes by which it was capable of
being taken; and thus, in his anxiety to spare a picture, did
he lose his only opportunity of gaining a victory. The
dwelling of Protogenes at this period was situate in a little
garden in the suburbs, or in other words, in the midst of the
camp of Demetrius. The combats that were taking place
made no difference whatever to the artist, and in no way interrupted
his proceeding with the works which he had commenced;
until at last he was summoned before the king, who
enquired how he could have the assurance thus to remain without
the walls. ‚ÄúBecause I know,‚Äù was his answer, ‚Äúthat you
are waging war with the Rhodians, and not with the arts.‚Äù
Upon this, the king, delighted at having the opportunity of
protecting the hand which he had thus spared, ordered a
guard to be placed at his disposal for the especial purpose of
his protection. In order, too, that he might not distract the
artist‚Äôs attention by sending for him too often, he would often
go, an enemy albeit, to pay him a visit, and, abandoning his
aspirations for victory, in the midst of arms and the battering
down of walls, would attentively examine the compositions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>painter. Even to this day, the story is still attached to the
picture  which he was then engaged upon, to the effect, that
Protogenes painted it beneath the sword. It is his Satyr,
known as the ‚ÄúAnapauomenos;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2057_2057"></a><a href="#Footnote_2057_2057" class="fnanchor">2057</a> in whose hand, to mark the
sense of security that he felt, the painter has placed a pair of
pipes.</p>

<p>Protogenes executed also, a Cydippe; a Tlepolemus; a
portrait of Philiscus, the tragic poet, in an attitude of meditation;
an Athlete; a portrait of King Antigonus, and one of
the mother of Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_2058_2058"></a><a href="#Footnote_2058_2058" class="fnanchor">2058</a> It was this philosopher too, who
advised him to paint the exploits of Alexander the Great, as
being certain to be held in everlasting remembrance. The
impulse, however, of his natural disposition, combined with a
certain artistic caprice, led him in preference to adopt the
various subjects which have just been mentioned. His last
works were representations of Alexander and the god Pan.
He also executed some figures in bronze, as already<a id="FNanchor_2059_2059"></a><a href="#Footnote_2059_2059" class="fnanchor">2059</a> stated.</p>

<p>At the same period also, lived Asclepiodorus,<a id="FNanchor_2060_2060"></a><a href="#Footnote_2060_2060" class="fnanchor">2060</a> who was
greatly admired by Apelles for his proportions. The tyrant
Mnason<a id="FNanchor_2061_2061"></a><a href="#Footnote_2061_2061" class="fnanchor">2061</a> paid him, for his picture of the Twelve Gods, at the
rate of thirty min√¶ for each divinity. This same Mnason also
paid Theomnestus twenty min√¶ for each of his Heroes.</p>

<p>In addition to these, it is only proper to mention Nicomachus,<a id="FNanchor_2062_2062"></a><a href="#Footnote_2062_2062" class="fnanchor">2062</a>
the son and disciple of Aristi√¶us. He painted a Rape of
Proserpina, a picture that was formerly in the Temple of
Minerva in the Capitol, above the shrine of Juventas.<a id="FNanchor_2063_2063"></a><a href="#Footnote_2063_2063" class="fnanchor">2063</a> Another
picture of his was to be seen also in the Capitol, placed there by
the Roman general Plancus,<a id="FNanchor_2064_2064"></a><a href="#Footnote_2064_2064" class="fnanchor">2064</a> a Victory soaring aloft in a
chariot: he was the first painter who represented Ulysses
wearing the pileus.<a id="FNanchor_2065_2065"></a><a href="#Footnote_2065_2065" class="fnanchor">2065</a> He painted also an Apollo and Diana;
the Mother<a id="FNanchor_2066_2066"></a><a href="#Footnote_2066_2066" class="fnanchor">2066</a> of the Gods seated on a Lion; the fine picture
of the Bacchantes, with Satyrs moving stealthily towards
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>them; and a Scylla, now at Rome in the Temple of Peace.
No painter ever worked with greater rapidity than Nicomachus;
indeed it is said, that on one occasion having entered
into an engagement with Aristratus,<a id="FNanchor_2067_2067"></a><a href="#Footnote_2067_2067" class="fnanchor">2067</a> the tyrant of Sicyon, to
paint within a given time the monument which he was raising
to the memory of the poet Telestis,<a id="FNanchor_2068_2068"></a><a href="#Footnote_2068_2068" class="fnanchor">2068</a> the artist only arrived a
few days before the expiration of the term; upon which, the
tyrant was so angry that he threatened to punish him: however,
in the few days that were left, Nicomachus, to the admiration
of all, completed the work, with equal promptitude
and success. Among his pupils, were his brother Ariston, his
son Aristides, and Philoxenus of Eretria, who painted for
King Cassander a picture representing one of the battles between
Alexander and Darius, a work which may bear comparison
with any. He also painted a picture in grotesque,
representing Three Sileni at their revels. Imitating the
celerity of execution displayed by his master, he introduced a
more sketchy style of painting, executed in a comparatively
off-hand manner.<a id="FNanchor_2069_2069"></a><a href="#Footnote_2069_2069" class="fnanchor">2069</a></p>

<p>To these artists Nicophanes<a id="FNanchor_2070_2070"></a><a href="#Footnote_2070_2070" class="fnanchor">2070</a> has also been added, an elegant
and finished painter, to whom for gracefulness few can
be compared, but for a severe and tragic style far inferior to
Zeuxis or Apelles. Perseus also belongs to this period, a pupil of
Apelles, who dedicated to him his work on painting. Aristides
of Thebes had for pupils his sons Niceros and Ariston. By
the latter of these artists, there is a Satyr crowned with a
chaplet and holding a goblet: two of his pupils were Antorides
and Euphranor, of the latter of whom we shall have to
make mention again.<a id="FNanchor_2071_2071"></a><a href="#Footnote_2071_2071" class="fnanchor">2071</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_37"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 37.‚ÄîVARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF PAINTING.</span></h3></div>

<p>We must now, however, make some mention of those
artists who acquired fame by the pencil in an inferior style of
painting. Among these was Pir√¶icus, inferior to few of the
painters in skill. I am not sure that he did not do injustice to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>himself by the choice of his subjects,<a id="FNanchor_2072_2072"></a><a href="#Footnote_2072_2072" class="fnanchor">2072</a> seeing that, although
he adopted an humble walk, he still attained in that walk the
highest reputation. His subjects were barbers‚Äô shops, cobblers‚Äô
stalls, jackasses, eatables, and the like, and to these he was
indebted for his epithet of ‚ÄúRhyparographos.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2073_2073"></a><a href="#Footnote_2073_2073" class="fnanchor">2073</a> His paintings,
however, are exquisitely pleasing, and have sold at higher
prices than the very largest works of many masters.</p>

<p>On the other hand again, as Varro tells us, a single picture
by Serapio covered the whole space of the balustrades,<a id="FNanchor_2074_2074"></a><a href="#Footnote_2074_2074" class="fnanchor">2074</a>
beneath the Old Shops,<a id="FNanchor_2075_2075"></a><a href="#Footnote_2075_2075" class="fnanchor">2075</a> where it was exhibited. This artist
was very successful in painting stage-scenery, but was unable
to depict the human form. Dionysius,<a id="FNanchor_2076_2076"></a><a href="#Footnote_2076_2076" class="fnanchor">2076</a> on the contrary,
painted nothing but men, and hence it was that he had the
surname of ‚ÄúAnthropographos.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2077_2077"></a><a href="#Footnote_2077_2077" class="fnanchor">2077</a> Callicles<a id="FNanchor_2078_2078"></a><a href="#Footnote_2078_2078" class="fnanchor">2078</a> also painted
some small pictures, and Calates executed some small works in
the comic style. Both of these styles were adopted by
Antiphilus;<a id="FNanchor_2079_2079"></a><a href="#Footnote_2079_2079" class="fnanchor">2079</a> who painted a very fine Hesione, and a Philip
and Alexander with Minerva, now in the School of the
Porticos<a id="FNanchor_2080_2080"></a><a href="#Footnote_2080_2080" class="fnanchor">2080</a> of Octavia. In the Portico of Philippus,<a id="FNanchor_2081_2081"></a><a href="#Footnote_2081_2081" class="fnanchor">2081</a> also,
there is a Father Liber<a id="FNanchor_2082_2082"></a><a href="#Footnote_2082_2082" class="fnanchor">2082</a> by him; an Alexander when a child;
and an Hippolytus alarmed at the Bull, which is rushing
upon him:<a id="FNanchor_2083_2083"></a><a href="#Footnote_2083_2083" class="fnanchor">2083</a> and in the Portico of Pompeius<a id="FNanchor_2084_2084"></a><a href="#Footnote_2084_2084" class="fnanchor">2084</a> we have his
Cadmus and Europa. On the other hand, again, he painted a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>figure in a ridiculous costume, known jocosely as the Gryllus;
and hence it is that pictures of this class<a id="FNanchor_2085_2085"></a><a href="#Footnote_2085_2085" class="fnanchor">2085</a> are generally known
as ‚ÄúGrylli.‚Äù Antiphilus was a native of Egypt, and received
instruction in the art from Ctesidemus.<a id="FNanchor_2086_2086"></a><a href="#Footnote_2086_2086" class="fnanchor">2086</a></p>

<p>It would not be right to pass in silence the painter of the
Temple at Ardea,<a id="FNanchor_2087_2087"></a><a href="#Footnote_2087_2087" class="fnanchor">2087</a> the more particularly as he was honoured
with the citizenship at that place, and with the following inscription
in verse upon one of the paintings which he executed
there:</p>

<p>
‚ÄúThese paintings, worthy of this worthy place,<br />
Temple of Juno, queen, and wife of Jove,<br />
Plautius Marcus,<a id="FNanchor_2088_2088"></a><a href="#Footnote_2088_2088" class="fnanchor">2088</a> from Alalia, made.<br />
May Ardea now and ever praise him for his skill.‚Äù<br />
</p>

<p>These lines are written in ancient Latin characters.</p>

<p>Ludius too, who lived in the time of the late Emperor
Augustus, must not be allowed to pass without some notice;
for he was the first to introduce the fashion of covering the
walls of our houses with most pleasing landscapes, representing
villas, porticos, ornamental gardening, woods, groves, hills,
fishponds, canals,<a id="FNanchor_2089_2089"></a><a href="#Footnote_2089_2089" class="fnanchor">2089</a> rivers, sea-shores, and anything else one
could desire; varied with figures of persons walking, sailing,
or proceeding to their villas, on asses or in carriages. Then,
too, there are others to be seen fishing, fowling, or gathering
in the vintage. In some of his decorations there are fine
villas to be seen, and roads to them across the marshes, with
women making<a id="FNanchor_2090_2090"></a><a href="#Footnote_2090_2090" class="fnanchor">2090</a> bargains to be carried across on men‚Äôs
shoulders, who move along slipping at every step and tottering
beneath their load; with numberless other subjects of a
similar nature, redolent of mirth and of the most amusing ingenuity.
It was this artist, too, who first decorated our uncovered<a id="FNanchor_2091_2091"></a><a href="#Footnote_2091_2091" class="fnanchor">2091</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>edifices with representations of maritime cities, a subject
which produces a most pleasing effect, and at a very trifling
expense.</p>

<p>But as for fame, that has been reserved solely for the artists
who have painted pictures; a thing that gives us all the more
reason to venerate the prudence displayed by the men of
ancient times. For with them, it was not the practice to
decorate the walls of houses, for the gratification of the
owners only; nor did they lavish all their resources upon a
dwelling which must of necessity always remain a fixture in
one spot, and admits of no removal in case of conflagration.
Protogenes was content with a cottage in his little garden;
Apelles had no paintings on the plaster of his walls; it not
being the fashion in their day to colour the party-walls of
houses from top to bottom. With all those artists, art was
ever watchful for the benefit of whole cities only, and in those
times a painter was regarded as the common property of all.</p>

<p>Shortly before the time of the late Emperor Augustus,
Arellius was in high esteem at Rome; and with fair reason,
had he not profaned the art by a disgraceful piece of profanity;
for, being always in love with some woman or other, it was
his practice, in painting goddesses, to give them the features of
his mistresses; hence it is, that there were always some figures
of prostitutes to be seen in his pictures. More recently, lived
Amulius,<a id="FNanchor_2092_2092"></a><a href="#Footnote_2092_2092" class="fnanchor">2092</a> a grave and serious personage, but a painter in
the florid style. By this artist there was a Minerva, which
had the appearance of always looking at the spectators, from
whatever point it was viewed. He only painted a few hours
each day, and then with the greatest gravity, for he always
kept the toga on, even when in the midst of his implements.
The Golden Palace<a id="FNanchor_2093_2093"></a><a href="#Footnote_2093_2093" class="fnanchor">2093</a> of Nero was the prison-house of this
artist‚Äôs productions, and hence it is that there are so few of
them to be be seen elsewhere.</p>

<p>Next in repute to him were Cornelius Pinus and Attius
Priscus, who painted the Temple of Honour and that of
Virtue,<a id="FNanchor_2094_2094"></a><a href="#Footnote_2094_2094" class="fnanchor">2094</a> on their restoration by the Emperor Vespasianus
Augustus. Priscus approaches more closely to the ancient
masters.</p>

CHAP. 38. (11.)‚ÄîAN EFFECTUAL WAY OF PUTTING A STOP TO THE
SINGING OF BIRDS.</span></h3></div>

<p>I must not omit here, in reference to painting, a celebrated
story that is told about Lepidus. During the Triumvirate,
when he was entertained by the magistrates of a certain place,
he had lodgings given him in a house that was wholly surrounded
with trees. The next day, he complained to them in
a threatening tone, that he had been unable to sleep for the
singing of the birds there. Accordingly, they had a dragon
painted, on pieces of parchment of the greatest length that
could possibly be obtained, and surrounded the grove with it;
a thing that so terrified the birds, it is said, that they became
silent at once; and hence it was that it first became known
how this object could be attained.</p>

<p>It is not agreed who was the inventor of the art of painting
in wax and in encaustic.<a id="FNanchor_2095_2095"></a><a href="#Footnote_2095_2095" class="fnanchor">2095</a> Some think that it was a discovery
of the painter Aristides,<a id="FNanchor_2096_2096"></a><a href="#Footnote_2096_2096" class="fnanchor">2096</a> and that it was afterwards brought to
perfection by Praxiteles: but there are encaustic paintings in
existence, of a somewhat prior date to them, those by Polygnotus,<a id="FNanchor_2097_2097"></a><a href="#Footnote_2097_2097" class="fnanchor">2097</a>
for example, and by Nicanor and Arcesila√ºs,<a id="FNanchor_2098_2098"></a><a href="#Footnote_2098_2098" class="fnanchor">2098</a> natives

<p>It is said, too, that Pamphilus,<a id="FNanchor_2100_2100"></a><a href="#Footnote_2100_2100" class="fnanchor">2100</a> the instructor of Apelles, not
only painted in encaustic, but also instructed Pausias<a id="FNanchor_2101_2101"></a><a href="#Footnote_2101_2101" class="fnanchor">2101</a> of Sicyon
in the art, the first who rendered himself distinguished in this
branch. Pausias was the son of Bryetes, by whom he was
originally instructed in the art of painting. He retouched
also with the pencil<a id="FNanchor_2102_2102"></a><a href="#Footnote_2102_2102" class="fnanchor">2102</a> some walls at Thespi√¶, then undergoing
repair, which had formerly been painted by Polygnotus. Upon
instituting a comparison, however, it was considered that he
was greatly inferior, this kind of painting not being in his
line. It was he, too, who first thought of painting ceilings:
nor had it been the practice before his day to use this kind of
decoration for arched roofs. He painted many small pictures
also, miniatures of children more particularly; a thing which,
according to the interpretation put upon it by his rivals, was
owing to the peculiarly slow process of encaustic painting.
The consequence was, that being determined to give a memorable
proof of his celerity of execution, he completed a picture
in the space of a single day, which was thence called the
‚ÄúHemeresios,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2103_2103"></a><a href="#Footnote_2103_2103" class="fnanchor">2103</a> representing the portrait of a child.</p>

<p>In his youth, he was enamoured of Glycera,<a id="FNanchor_2104_2104"></a><a href="#Footnote_2104_2104" class="fnanchor">2104</a> his fellow-townswoman,
the first inventor of chaplets; and in his rivalry
of the skill shown by her, he achieved so much success in the
encaustic art, as to reproduce the almost numberless tints displayed
by flowers. At a later period, he painted her, seated,
with a chaplet on, and thus produced one of the very finest
of his pictures; known as the ‚ÄúStephaneplocos‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2105_2105"></a><a href="#Footnote_2105_2105" class="fnanchor">2105</a> by
some, and as the ‚ÄúStephanopolis‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2106_2106"></a><a href="#Footnote_2106_2106" class="fnanchor">2106</a> by others; from the circumstance
that Glycera had supported herself in her poverty by
selling these chaplets. A copy of this picture, usually known
as an ‚Äúapographon,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2107_2107"></a><a href="#Footnote_2107_2107" class="fnanchor">2107</a> was purchased by L. Lucullus at Athens,
during the festival of the Dionysia, at the price of two talents.</p>

<p>Pausias also painted some large pictures, a Sacrifice of Oxen,
for instance, which used to be seen in the Portico of Pompeius.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>In this painting he invented several improvements,
which many artists have since imitated, but none with the
same success. Although in the picture it was particularly his
desire to give an impression of the length of the ox, he
painted it with a front view and not sideways, and still has
caused the large dimensions of the animal to be fully understood.
And then too, whereas all other painters colour in
white such parts as they wish to have the appearance of
being prominent, and in black such portions as are intended
to remain in the back-ground, he has painted the whole of the
ox of a black colour, and has shown the dimensions of the
body which throws the shadow by the medium of the shadow
itself; thus evincing a wonderful degree of skill in showing
relief upon a coat painted with a single colour, and conveying
an impression of uniform solidity upon a broken ground.<a id="FNanchor_2108_2108"></a><a href="#Footnote_2108_2108" class="fnanchor">2108</a> It
was at Sicyon also that Pausias passed his life, a city which
for a long time continued to be the native place of painting.
Ultimately, all the paintings belonging to that place were sold
by public auction for the discharge of the debts owing by the
city, and were transferred to Rome in the √¶dileship of
Scaurus.<a id="FNanchor_2109_2109"></a><a href="#Footnote_2109_2109" class="fnanchor">2109</a></p>

<p>Next to him, in the hundred and fourth Olympiad, Euphranor,<a id="FNanchor_2110_2110"></a><a href="#Footnote_2110_2110" class="fnanchor">2110</a>
the Isthmian, distinguished himself far beyond all
others, an artist who has been already mentioned in our
account of the statuaries. He executed some colossal figures
also, and some statues in marble, and he chased some drinking-vessels;
being studious and laborious in the highest degree,
excellent in every branch, and at all times equal to himself.
This artist seems to have been the first to represent heroes with
becoming dignity, and to have paid particular attention to symmetry.
Still, however, in the generality of instances, he has
made the body slight in proportion to the head and limbs. He
composed some treatises also upon symmetry and colours. His
works are, an Equestrian Combat;<a id="FNanchor_2111_2111"></a><a href="#Footnote_2111_2111" class="fnanchor">2111</a> the Twelve Gods; and a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>Theseus; with reference to which he remarked that the Theseus
of Parrhasius had been fed upon roses, but his own upon beef.<a id="FNanchor_2112_2112"></a><a href="#Footnote_2112_2112" class="fnanchor">2112</a>
There are also at Ephesus some famous pictures by him; an
Ulysses, in his feigned madness, yoking together an ox and a
horse; Men, in an attitude of meditation, wearing the pallium;<a id="FNanchor_2113_2113"></a><a href="#Footnote_2113_2113" class="fnanchor">2113</a>
and a Warrior, sheathing his sword.</p>

<p>At the same time, also, flourished Cydias;<a id="FNanchor_2114_2114"></a><a href="#Footnote_2114_2114" class="fnanchor">2114</a> for whose picture
of the Argonaut√¶ the orator Hortensius paid one hundred and
forty-four thousand sesterces, and had a shrine constructed
expressly for its reception on his estate at Tusculum.<a id="FNanchor_2115_2115"></a><a href="#Footnote_2115_2115" class="fnanchor">2115</a> There
was also Antidotus, a pupil of Euphranor, by whom there is,
at Athens, a Combatant armed with a shield; a Wrestler, also;
and a Trumpeter, a work which has been considered a most
exquisite production.</p>

<p>Antidotus, as a painter, was more careful in his works than
prolific, and his colouring was of a severe style. His principal
glory was his having been the instructor of Nicias<a id="FNanchor_2116_2116"></a><a href="#Footnote_2116_2116" class="fnanchor">2116</a> of
Athens; who was a most careful painter of female portraits,
and a strict observer of light and shade,<a id="FNanchor_2117_2117"></a><a href="#Footnote_2117_2117" class="fnanchor">2117</a> making it his especial
care that the figures in his pictures should appear in
the boldest relief. His works are, a Nemea, which was
brought from Asia to Rome by Silanus, and was placed in
the Curia, as already stated;<a id="FNanchor_2118_2118"></a><a href="#Footnote_2118_2118" class="fnanchor">2118</a> a Father Liber,<a id="FNanchor_2119_2119"></a><a href="#Footnote_2119_2119" class="fnanchor">2119</a> in the
Temple<a id="FNanchor_2120_2120"></a><a href="#Footnote_2120_2120" class="fnanchor">2120</a> of Concord; a Hyacinthus,<a id="FNanchor_2121_2121"></a><a href="#Footnote_2121_2121" class="fnanchor">2121</a> which the Emperor
Augustus was so delighted with, that he took it away with
him after the capture of Alexandria; for which reason also it
was consecrated in the Temple<a id="FNanchor_2122_2122"></a><a href="#Footnote_2122_2122" class="fnanchor">2122</a> of Augustus by the Emperor
Tiberius; and a Dana√´. At Ephesus, there is a tomb by
him of a megabyzus,<a id="FNanchor_2123_2123"></a><a href="#Footnote_2123_2123" class="fnanchor">2123</a> or priest of the Ephesian Diana; and at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>Athens a representation of the Necyomantea<a id="FNanchor_2124_2124"></a><a href="#Footnote_2124_2124" class="fnanchor">2124</a> of Homer;
which last he declined to sell to King Attalus for sixty
talents, and in preference, so rich was he, made a present of
it to his own native place. He also executed some large
pictures, among which there are a Calypso, an Io, an Andromeda,
a very fine Alexander, in the Porticos<a id="FNanchor_2125_2125"></a><a href="#Footnote_2125_2125" class="fnanchor">2125</a> of Pompeius,
and a Calypso, seated. To this painter also there are some
pictures of cattle attributed, and in his dogs he has been remarkably
successful. It was this Nicias, with reference to
whom, Praxiteles, when asked with which of all his works in
marble he was the best pleased, made answer, ‚ÄúThose to
which Nicias has set his hand,‚Äù so highly did he esteem the
colouring of that artist. It has not been satisfactorily ascertained
whether it is this artist or another of the same name
that some writers have placed in the hundred and twelfth
Olympiad.</p>

<p>With Nicias has been compared, and indeed sometimes
preferred to him, Athenion of Maronea,<a id="FNanchor_2126_2126"></a><a href="#Footnote_2126_2126" class="fnanchor">2126</a> a pupil of Glaucion
of Corinth. In his colouring he is more sombre than Nicias,
and yet, with all his sombreness, more pleasing; so much so
indeed, that in his paintings shines forth the extensive knowledge
which he possessed of the art. He painted, in the
Temple at Eleusis, a Phylarchus;<a id="FNanchor_2127_2127"></a><a href="#Footnote_2127_2127" class="fnanchor">2127</a> and at Athens, a family
group, which has been known as the ‚ÄúSyngenicon;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2128_2128"></a><a href="#Footnote_2128_2128" class="fnanchor">2128</a> an
Achilles also, concealed in a female dress, and Ulysses detecting
him; a group of six whole-length figures, in one
picture; and, a work which has contributed to his fame more
than any other, a Groom leading a Horse. Indeed, if he had
not died young, there would have been no one comparable to
Athenion in painting.</p>

<p>Heraclides, too, of Macedon, had some repute as an artist.
At first he was a painter of ships, but afterwards, on the capture
of King Perseus, he removed to Athens; where at the
same period was also Metrodorus,<a id="FNanchor_2129_2129"></a><a href="#Footnote_2129_2129" class="fnanchor">2129</a> who was both a painter
and a philosopher, and of considerable celebrity in both
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>branches. Hence it was, that when L. Paulus √Ümilius, after
the conquest of Perseus,<a id="FNanchor_2130_2130"></a><a href="#Footnote_2130_2130" class="fnanchor">2130</a> requested the Athenians to send
him the most esteemed philosopher for the education of his
children, and a painter to represent his triumph, they made
choice of Metrodorus, declaring that he was eminently suited
for either purpose; a thing which Paulus admitted to be the
case.</p>

<p>Timomachus of Byzantium, in the time of the Dictator C√¶sar,
painted an Ajax<a id="FNanchor_2131_2131"></a><a href="#Footnote_2131_2131" class="fnanchor">2131</a> and a Medea, which were placed by C√¶sar
in the Temple of Venus Genetrix, having been purchased at
the price of eighty talents; the value of the Attic talent
being, according to M. Varro, equivalent to six thousand
denarii. An Orestes, also by Timomachus, an Iphigenia in
Tauris, and a Lecythion, a teacher of gymnastics, are equally
praised; a Noble Family also; and Two Men clothed in the
pallium,<a id="FNanchor_2132_2132"></a><a href="#Footnote_2132_2132" class="fnanchor">2132</a> and about to enter into conversation, the one standing,
the other in a sitting posture. It is in his picture, however
of the Gorgon,<a id="FNanchor_2133_2133"></a><a href="#Footnote_2133_2133" class="fnanchor">2133</a> that the art appears to have favoured
him most highly.</p>

<p>Aristola√ºs, the son and pupil of Pausias, was one of the
painters in a more severe style: there are by him an Epaminondas,
a Pericles, a Medea, a Theseus, an emblematical
picture of the Athenian People, and a Sacrifice of Oxen.
Some persons, too, are pleased with the careful style of
Nicophanes,<a id="FNanchor_2134_2134"></a><a href="#Footnote_2134_2134" class="fnanchor">2134</a> who was also a pupil of Pausias; a carefulness,
however, which only artists can appreciate, as in other
respects he was harsh in his colours, and too lavish of sil;<a id="FNanchor_2135_2135"></a><a href="#Footnote_2135_2135" class="fnanchor">2135</a> as
in his picture, for example, of √Üsculapius with his daughters,
Hygia,<a id="FNanchor_2136_2136"></a><a href="#Footnote_2136_2136" class="fnanchor">2136</a> √Ügle, and Panacea, his Jason, and his Sluggard,
known as the ‚ÄúOcnos,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2137_2137"></a><a href="#Footnote_2137_2137" class="fnanchor">2137</a> a man twisting a rope at one end
as an ass gnaws it at the other. As to Socrates,<a id="FNanchor_2138_2138"></a><a href="#Footnote_2138_2138" class="fnanchor">2138</a> his pictures
are, with good reason, universally esteemed.</p>

<p>Having now mentioned the principal painters in either
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>branch,<a id="FNanchor_2139_2139"></a><a href="#Footnote_2139_2139" class="fnanchor">2139</a> I must not pass in silence those who occupy the
next rank. Aristoclides decorated the Temple of Apollo at
Delphi. Antiphilus<a id="FNanchor_2140_2140"></a><a href="#Footnote_2140_2140" class="fnanchor">2140</a> is highly praised for his picture of a
Boy blowing a Fire, which illumines an apartment handsomely
furnished, and throws a light<a id="FNanchor_2141_2141"></a><a href="#Footnote_2141_2141" class="fnanchor">2141</a> upon the features of the
youth; a Spinning-room, with women plying their respective
tasks; and a King Ptolem√¶us hunting. But his most famous
picture is his Satyr, clad in a panther‚Äôs skin, and known as
the ‚ÄúAposcopeuon.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2142_2142"></a><a href="#Footnote_2142_2142" class="fnanchor">2142</a> Aristophon<a id="FNanchor_2143_2143"></a><a href="#Footnote_2143_2143" class="fnanchor">2143</a> has painted an Anc√¶us<a id="FNanchor_2144_2144"></a><a href="#Footnote_2144_2144" class="fnanchor">2144</a>
wounded by the Boar, with Astypale, the sharer of his grief;
and a picture with numerous figures, representing Priam,
Helena, Credulity, Ulysses, Deiphobus, and Guile.<a id="FNanchor_2145_2145"></a><a href="#Footnote_2145_2145" class="fnanchor">2145</a> Androbius
has painted a Scyllus<a id="FNanchor_2146_2146"></a><a href="#Footnote_2146_2146" class="fnanchor">2146</a> cutting away the anchors of the Persian
fleet: and Artemon a Dana√´, with Robbers in admiration;
a Queen Stratonice;<a id="FNanchor_2147_2147"></a><a href="#Footnote_2147_2147" class="fnanchor">2147</a> and a Hercules and Deianira. But the
finest of all this artist‚Äôs works are those now in the buildings
of Octavia; a Hercules ascending to heaven, with the sanction
of the gods, from his funeral pile upon Mount ≈íta in Doris;
and the story of Laomedon and his bargain<a id="FNanchor_2148_2148"></a><a href="#Footnote_2148_2148" class="fnanchor">2148</a> with Hercules
and Neptune. Alcimachus has painted Dioxippus,<a id="FNanchor_2149_2149"></a><a href="#Footnote_2149_2149" class="fnanchor">2149</a> who was
victorious in the pancratium at Olympia, without raising the
dust; a victory known to the Greeks as being gained ‚Äúaconiti.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2150_2150"></a><a href="#Footnote_2150_2150" class="fnanchor">2150</a>
C≈ìnus painted pedigrees.<a id="FNanchor_2151_2151"></a><a href="#Footnote_2151_2151" class="fnanchor">2151</a></p>

<p>Ctesilochus, a pupil<a id="FNanchor_2152_2152"></a><a href="#Footnote_2152_2152" class="fnanchor">2152</a> of Apelles, was famous for a burlesque
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>picture of his representing Jupiter in labour with Bacchus,<a id="FNanchor_2153_2153"></a><a href="#Footnote_2153_2153" class="fnanchor">2153</a>
with a mitra<a id="FNanchor_2154_2154"></a><a href="#Footnote_2154_2154" class="fnanchor">2154</a> on his head, and crying like a woman in the
midst of the goddesses, who are acting as midwives. Cleon
distinguished himself by his Cadmus; and Ctesidemus, by his
Capture of ≈íchalia<a id="FNanchor_2155_2155"></a><a href="#Footnote_2155_2155" class="fnanchor">2155</a> and his Laodamia.</p>

<p>Ctesicles became notorious for the insult which he offered
to Queen Stratonice;<a id="FNanchor_2156_2156"></a><a href="#Footnote_2156_2156" class="fnanchor">2156</a> for, upon failing to meet with an
honourable reception from her, he painted her, romping with
a fisherman, for whom, according to common report, she had
conceived an ardent affection. After exhibiting this picture
in the harbour at Ephesus, he at once set sail and escaped:
the queen, however, would not allow of its removal, the likenesses
of the two figures being so admirably expressed. Cratinus,<a id="FNanchor_2157_2157"></a><a href="#Footnote_2157_2157" class="fnanchor">2157</a>
the comic writer, painted at Athens, in the Pompeion<a id="FNanchor_2158_2158"></a><a href="#Footnote_2158_2158" class="fnanchor">2158</a>
there.</p>

<p>Of Eutychides, there is a Victory guiding a chariot drawn by
two horses. Eudorus is famous for his dramatic scenery; he
executed some statues in bronze also. By Hippys there is a
Neptune and Victory. Habron painted a picture of Friendship
and Concord, and several figures of divinities; Leontiscus,
an Aratus with the trophies of victory,<a id="FNanchor_2159_2159"></a><a href="#Footnote_2159_2159" class="fnanchor">2159</a> and a Singing-girl;
Leon, a portrait of Sappho; and Nearchus, a Venus attended
by Cupids and Graces, and a Hercules, sorrowing and repentant
at the sad results of his madness.<a id="FNanchor_2160_2160"></a><a href="#Footnote_2160_2160" class="fnanchor">2160</a> Nealces,<a id="FNanchor_2161_2161"></a><a href="#Footnote_2161_2161" class="fnanchor">2161</a> a remarkably
ingenious and inventive artist, painted a Venus. On one occasion,
when he had to represent a naval engagement between
the Persians and Egyptians, wishing it to be understood that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>it took place on the river Nilus, the waters of which are similar
in appearance to those of the sea, he employed an emblem to
disclose that which would not admit of expression by art; for he
painted an ass drinking on the shore, and a crocodile lying in
wait for him.<a id="FNanchor_2162_2162"></a><a href="#Footnote_2162_2162" class="fnanchor">2162</a></p>

<p>≈ínias has painted a Family Group; Philiscus, a Painter‚Äôs
Studio, with a boy blowing the fire; Phalerion, a Scylla; Simonides,
an Agatharchus and a Mnemosyne; Simus, a youth
reposing, a Fuller‚Äôs Shop, a person celebrating the Quinquatria,<a id="FNanchor_2163_2163"></a><a href="#Footnote_2163_2163" class="fnanchor">2163</a>
and a Nemesis of great merit. By Theorus<a id="FNanchor_2164_2164"></a><a href="#Footnote_2164_2164" class="fnanchor">2164</a> there is a
Man Anointing himself; a picture of the Murder of √Ügisthus
and Clyt√¶mnestra by Orestes; and a representation of the
Trojan War, in a series of paintings, now at Rome, in the
Porticos<a id="FNanchor_2165_2165"></a><a href="#Footnote_2165_2165" class="fnanchor">2165</a> of Philippus: a Cassandra<a id="FNanchor_2166_2166"></a><a href="#Footnote_2166_2166" class="fnanchor">2166</a> also, in the Temple of
Concord; a Leontium, the mistress of Epicurus, in an attitude
of meditation; and a King Demetrius.<a id="FNanchor_2167_2167"></a><a href="#Footnote_2167_2167" class="fnanchor">2167</a> Theon<a id="FNanchor_2168_2168"></a><a href="#Footnote_2168_2168" class="fnanchor">2168</a> has painted
the Frenzy<a id="FNanchor_2169_2169"></a><a href="#Footnote_2169_2169" class="fnanchor">2169</a> of Orestes, and a Thamyras<a id="FNanchor_2170_2170"></a><a href="#Footnote_2170_2170" class="fnanchor">2170</a> playing on the
lyre; Tauriscus, a Discobolus,<a id="FNanchor_2171_2171"></a><a href="#Footnote_2171_2171" class="fnanchor">2171</a> a Clyt√¶mnestra, a Pan in miniature,
a Polynices claiming<a id="FNanchor_2172_2172"></a><a href="#Footnote_2172_2172" class="fnanchor">2172</a> the sovereignty, and a Capaneus.<a id="FNanchor_2173_2173"></a><a href="#Footnote_2173_2173" class="fnanchor">2173</a></p>

<p>In speaking of these artists, I must not omit to mention
one memorable circumstance: Erigonus, who was colour-grinder
to the painter Nealces, himself made such progress in
the art as to leave a very celebrated pupil, Pasias, the brother of
√Ügineta, the modeller. It is also a very singular fact, and one
well deserving of remark, that the last works of these artists,
their unfinished paintings, in fact, are held in greater admiration
than their completed works; the Iris of Aristides, for instance,
the Tyndarid√¶<a id="FNanchor_2174_2174"></a><a href="#Footnote_2174_2174" class="fnanchor">2174</a> of Nicomachus, the Medea of Timomachus,<a id="FNanchor_2175_2175"></a><a href="#Footnote_2175_2175" class="fnanchor">2175</a>
and the Venus of Apelles,<a id="FNanchor_2176_2176"></a><a href="#Footnote_2176_2176" class="fnanchor">2176</a> already mentioned. For in such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>works as these, we not only see the outline depicted, and the
very thoughts of the artist expressed, but have the composition
additionally commended to our notice by the regrets which we
must necessarily feel on finding the hand that commenced it
arrested by death.</p>

<p>There are still some other artists, who, though by no means
without reputation, can only be noticed here in a summary
manner: Aristocydes; Anaxander; Aristobulus of Syria;
Arcesilas,<a id="FNanchor_2177_2177"></a><a href="#Footnote_2177_2177" class="fnanchor">2177</a> son of Tisicrates; Cor≈ìbos, a pupil of Nicomachus;
Charmantides, a pupil of Euphranor; Dionysodorus of Colophon;
Dic√¶ogenes, a contemporary of King Demetrius;<a id="FNanchor_2178_2178"></a><a href="#Footnote_2178_2178" class="fnanchor">2178</a> Euthymides;
Heraclides<a id="FNanchor_2179_2179"></a><a href="#Footnote_2179_2179" class="fnanchor">2179</a> of Macedon; Milo of Soli, a pupil of the statuary
Pyromachus; Mnasitheus of Sicyon; Mnasitimus, the son and
pupil of Aristonidas;<a id="FNanchor_2180_2180"></a><a href="#Footnote_2180_2180" class="fnanchor">2180</a> Nessus, son of Habron;<a id="FNanchor_2181_2181"></a><a href="#Footnote_2181_2181" class="fnanchor">2181</a> Polemon of
Alexandria; Theodorus of Samos, and Stadieus, pupils of
Nicosthenes; and Xeno of Sicyon, a pupil of Neocles.</p>

<p>There have been some female painters also. Timarete, the
daughter of Micon,<a id="FNanchor_2182_2182"></a><a href="#Footnote_2182_2182" class="fnanchor">2182</a> painted a Diana at Ephesus, one of the
very oldest panel-paintings known. Irene, daughter and
pupil of the artist Cratinus,<a id="FNanchor_2183_2183"></a><a href="#Footnote_2183_2183" class="fnanchor">2183</a> painted a figure of a girl, now
at Eleusis, a Calypso, an Aged Man, the juggler Theodorus,
and Alcisthenes the dancer. Aristarete, daughter and pupil of
Nearchus, painted an √Üsculapius. Iaia of Cyzicus, who always
remained single, painted at Rome, in the youth of M. Varro,
both with the brush, and with the graver,<a id="FNanchor_2184_2184"></a><a href="#Footnote_2184_2184" class="fnanchor">2184</a> upon ivory, her subjects
being female portraits mostly. At Naples, there is a large
picture by her, the portrait of an Old Woman; as also a portrait
of herself, taken by the aid of a mirror. There was no painter
superior to her for expedition; while at the same time her
artistic skill was such, that her works sold at much higher
prices than those of the most celebrated portrait-painters of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>her day, Sopolis namely, and Dionysius,<a id="FNanchor_2185_2185"></a><a href="#Footnote_2185_2185" class="fnanchor">2185</a> with whose pictures
our galleries are filled. One Olympias painted also, but nothing
is known relative to her, except that she had Autobulus
for a pupil.</p>

<p>In ancient times there were but two methods of encaustic<a id="FNanchor_2186_2186"></a><a href="#Footnote_2186_2186" class="fnanchor">2186</a>
painting, in wax and on ivory,<a id="FNanchor_2187_2187"></a><a href="#Footnote_2187_2187" class="fnanchor">2187</a> with the cestrum or pointed
graver. When, however, this art came to be applied to the
painting of ships of war, a third method was adopted, that of
melting the wax colours and laying them on with a brush,
while hot.<a id="FNanchor_2188_2188"></a><a href="#Footnote_2188_2188" class="fnanchor">2188</a> Painting of this nature,<a id="FNanchor_2189_2189"></a><a href="#Footnote_2189_2189" class="fnanchor">2189</a> applied to vessels, will

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_42"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 42.‚ÄîTHE COLOURING OF TISSUES.</span></h3></div>

<p>In Egypt, too, they employ a very remarkable process for the
colouring of tissues. After pressing the material, which is white
at first, they saturate it, not with colours, but with mordents
that are calculated to absorb colour. This done, the tissues,
still unchanged in appearance, are plunged into a cauldron of
boiling dye, and are removed the next moment fully coloured.
It is a singular fact, too, that although the dye in the pan is of
one uniform colour, the material when taken out of it is of
various colours, according to the nature of the mordents that
have been respectively applied to it: these colours, too, will never
wash out. Thus the dye-pan, which under ordinary circumstances,

if coloured tissues had been put into it, is here made to yield
several colours from a single dye. At the same moment that
it dyes the tissues, it boils in the colour; and it is the fact,
that material which has been thus submitted to the action of
fire becomes stouter and more serviceable for wear, than it
would have been if it had not been subjected to the process.</p>

CHAP. 43. (12.)‚ÄîTHE INVENTORS OF THE ART OF MODELLING.</span></h3></div>

<p>On painting we have now said enough, and more than enough;
but it will be only proper to append some accounts of the
plastic art. Butades, a potter of Sicyon, was the first who invented,
at Corinth, the art of modelling portraits in the earth
which he used in his trade. It was through his daughter that
he made the discovery; who, being deeply in love with a young
man about to depart on a long journey, traced the profile of
his face, as thrown upon the wall by the light of the lamp. Upon
seeing this, her father filled in the outline, by compressing clay
upon the surface, and so made a face in relief, which he then
hardened by fire along with other articles of pottery. This
model, it is said, was preserved in the Nymph√¶um<a id="FNanchor_2190_2190"></a><a href="#Footnote_2190_2190" class="fnanchor">2190</a> at Corinth,
until the destruction of that city by Mummius.<a id="FNanchor_2191_2191"></a><a href="#Footnote_2191_2191" class="fnanchor">2191</a> Others, again,
assert that the first inventors of the plastic art were Rh≈ìcus<a id="FNanchor_2192_2192"></a><a href="#Footnote_2192_2192" class="fnanchor">2192</a>
and Theodorus,<a id="FNanchor_2193_2193"></a><a href="#Footnote_2193_2193" class="fnanchor">2193</a> at Samos, a considerable period before the expulsion
of the Bacchiad√¶ from Corinth: and that Damaratus,<a id="FNanchor_2194_2194"></a><a href="#Footnote_2194_2194" class="fnanchor">2194</a>
on taking to flight from that place and settling in Etruria, where
he became father of Tarquinius, who was ultimately king of
the Roman people, was accompanied thither by the modellers
Euchir,<a id="FNanchor_2195_2195"></a><a href="#Footnote_2195_2195" class="fnanchor">2195</a> Diopus, and Eugrammus, by whose agency the art
was first introduced into Italy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>Butades first invented the method of colouring plastic compositions,
by adding red earth to the material, or else modelling
them in red chalk: he, too, was the first to make masks on the
outer edges of gutter-tiles upon the roofs of buildings; in
low relief, and known as ‚Äúprostypa‚Äù at first, but afterwards
in high relief, or ‚Äúectypa.‚Äù It was in these designs,<a id="FNanchor_2196_2196"></a><a href="#Footnote_2196_2196" class="fnanchor">2196</a> too, that
the ornaments on the pediments of temples originated;
and from this invention modellers first had their name of
‚Äúplast√¶.‚Äù</p>

CHAP. 44.‚ÄîWHO WAS THE FIRST TO MOULD FIGURES IN IMITATION
OF THE FEATURES OF LIVING PERSONS, OR OF STATUES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The first person who expressed the human features by fitting
a mould of plaster upon the face, and then improving it by
pouring melted wax into the cast, was Lysistratus<a id="FNanchor_2197_2197"></a><a href="#Footnote_2197_2197" class="fnanchor">2197</a> of Sicyon,
brother of Lysippus, already mentioned. It was he, in fact,
who first made it his study to give a faithful likeness; for
before his time, artists only thought how to make their portraits
as handsome as possible. The same artist, too, was the
first who thought of making models for his statues; a method
which afterwards became so universally adopted, that there
could be neither figure nor statue made without its model in
clay. Hence it would appear, that the art of modelling in
clay is more ancient than that of moulding in bronze.<a id="FNanchor_2198_2198"></a><a href="#Footnote_2198_2198" class="fnanchor">2198</a></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_45"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 45.‚ÄîTHE MOST FAMOUS MODELLERS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The most celebrated modellers were Damophilus and Gorgasus,
who were painters as well. These artists adorned with
their works, in both kinds, the Temple of Ceres,<a id="FNanchor_2199_2199"></a><a href="#Footnote_2199_2199" class="fnanchor">2199</a> in the Circus
Maximus at Rome; with an inscription in Greek, which
stated that the decorations on the right-hand were the workmanship
of Damophilus, and those on the left, of Gorgasus.
Varro says that, before the construction of this temple, everything
was Tuscan<a id="FNanchor_2200_2200"></a><a href="#Footnote_2200_2200" class="fnanchor">2200</a> in the temples; and that, when the temple
was afterwards repaired, the painted coatings of the walls were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>cut away in tablets and enclosed in frames, but that the figures
on the pediments were dispersed. Chalcosthenes,<a id="FNanchor_2201_2201"></a><a href="#Footnote_2201_2201" class="fnanchor">2201</a> too,<a id="FNanchor_2202_2202"></a><a href="#Footnote_2202_2202" class="fnanchor">2202</a> executed
at Athens some works in unbaked earth, on the spot
which, from his manufactory, has since obtained the name of
‚ÄúCeramicus.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2203_2203"></a><a href="#Footnote_2203_2203" class="fnanchor">2203</a></p>

<p>M. Varro states that he knew an artist at Rome, Possis by
name, who executed fruit, grapes, and fish, with such exactness,
that it was quite impossible, by only looking at them, to
distinguish them from the reality. He speaks very highly
also of Arcesila√ºs,<a id="FNanchor_2204_2204"></a><a href="#Footnote_2204_2204" class="fnanchor">2204</a> who was on terms of intimacy with
Lucius Lucullus,<a id="FNanchor_2205_2205"></a><a href="#Footnote_2205_2205" class="fnanchor">2205</a> and whose models in plaster used to sell at
a higher rate, among artists themselves, than the works of
others. He informs us, also, that it was by this modeller that
the Venus Genetrix in the Forum of C√¶sar was executed, it
having been erected before completion, in the great haste that
there was to consecrate it; that the same artist had made an
agreement with Lucullus to execute a figure of Felicity, at the
price of sixty thousand sesterces, the completion of which was
prevented by their death; and that Octavius, a Roman of
equestrian rank, being desirous of a model for a mixing-bowl,<a id="FNanchor_2206_2206"></a><a href="#Footnote_2206_2206" class="fnanchor">2206</a>
Arcesila√ºs made him one in plaster, at the price of one talent.</p>

<p>Varro praises Pasiteles<a id="FNanchor_2207_2207"></a><a href="#Footnote_2207_2207" class="fnanchor">2207</a> also, who used to say, that the
plastic art was the mother of chasing, statuary, and sculpture,
and who, excellent as he was in each of these branches, never
executed any work without first modelling it. In addition to
these particulars, he states that the art of modelling was
anciently cultivated in Italy, Etruria in particular; and that
Volcanius was summoned from Veii, and entrusted by Tarquinius
Priscus with making the figure of Jupiter, which he
intended to consecrate in the Capitol; that this Jupiter was
made of clay, and that hence arose the custom of painting it
with minium;<a id="FNanchor_2208_2208"></a><a href="#Footnote_2208_2208" class="fnanchor">2208</a> and that the four-horse chariot, so often<a id="FNanchor_2209_2209"></a><a href="#Footnote_2209_2209" class="fnanchor">2209</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>mentioned, upon the pediment of the temple, was made of clay
as well. We learn also from him, that it was by the same
artist that the Hercules was executed, which, even to this day,
is named<a id="FNanchor_2210_2210"></a><a href="#Footnote_2210_2210" class="fnanchor">2210</a> at Rome from the material of which it is composed.
Such, in those times, were the most esteemed statues of the
gods; and small reason have we to complain of our forefathers
for worshipping such divinities as these; for in their day there
was no working of gold and silver‚Äîno, not even in the
service of the gods.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_46"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 46.‚ÄîWORKS IN POTTERY.</span></h3></div>

<p>Statues of this nature are still in existence at various
places. At Rome, in fact, and in our municipal towns, we
still see many such pediments of temples; wonderful too, for their
workmanship, and, from their artistic merit and long duration,
more deserving of our respect than gold, and certainly far less
baneful. At the present day even, in the midst of such
wealth as we possess, we make our first libation at the sacrifice,
not from murrhine<a id="FNanchor_2211_2211"></a><a href="#Footnote_2211_2211" class="fnanchor">2211</a> vases or vessels of crystal, but from ladles<a id="FNanchor_2212_2212"></a><a href="#Footnote_2212_2212" class="fnanchor">2212</a>
made of earthenware.</p>

<p>Bounteous beyond expression is the earth, if we only consider
in detail her various gifts. To omit all mention of the cereals,
wine, fruits, herbs, shrubs, medicaments, and metals, bounties
which she has lavished upon us, and which have already passed
under our notice, her productions in the shape of pottery
alone, would more than suffice, in their variety, to satisfy our
domestic wants; what with gutter-tiles of earthenware, vats for
receiving wine, pipes<a id="FNanchor_2213_2213"></a><a href="#Footnote_2213_2213" class="fnanchor">2213</a> for conveying water, conduits<a id="FNanchor_2214_2214"></a><a href="#Footnote_2214_2214" class="fnanchor">2214</a> for
supplying baths, baked tiles for roofs, bricks for foundations,
the productions, too, of the potter‚Äôs wheel; results, all of
them, of an art, which induced King Numa to establish, as a
seventh company,<a id="FNanchor_2215_2215"></a><a href="#Footnote_2215_2215" class="fnanchor">2215</a> that of the makers of earthenware.</p>

<p>Even more than this, many persons have chosen to be buried
in coffins<a id="FNanchor_2216_2216"></a><a href="#Footnote_2216_2216" class="fnanchor">2216</a> made of earthenware; M. Varro, for instance, who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>was interred, in true Pythagorean style, in the midst of leaves
of myrtle, olive, and black poplar; indeed, the greater part of
mankind make use of earthen vases for this purpose. For the
service of the table, the Samian pottery is even yet held in high
esteem; that, too, of Arretium in Italy, still maintains its high
character; while for their cups, and for those only, the manufactories
of Surrentum, Asta, Pollentia, Saguntum in Spain,
and Pergamus in Asia,<a id="FNanchor_2217_2217"></a><a href="#Footnote_2217_2217" class="fnanchor">2217</a> are greatly esteemed.</p>

<p>The city of Tralles, too, in Asia, and that of Mutina in Italy,
have their respective manufactures of earthenware, and even
by this branch of art are localities rendered famous; their productions,
by the aid of the potter‚Äôs wheel, becoming known to
all countries, and conveyed by sea and by land to every
quarter of the earth. At Erythr√¶, there are still shown, in
a temple there, two amphor√¶, that were consecrated in consequence
of the singular thinness of the material: they originated
in a contest between a master and his pupil, which of the
two could make earthenware of the greatest thinness. The
vessels of Cos are the most highly celebrated for their beauty,
hut those of Adria<a id="FNanchor_2218_2218"></a><a href="#Footnote_2218_2218" class="fnanchor">2218</a> are considered the most substantial.</p>

<p>In relation to these productions of art, there are some instances
of severity mentioned: Q. Coponius, we find, was
condemned for bribery, because he made present of an amphora
of wine to a person who had the right of voting. To
make luxury, too, conduce in some degree to enhance our estimation
of earthenware, ‚Äútripatinium,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2219_2219"></a><a href="#Footnote_2219_2219" class="fnanchor">2219</a> as we learn from
Fenestella, was the name given to the most exquisite course of
dishes that was served up at the Roman banquets. It consisted
of one dish of mur√¶n√¶,<a id="FNanchor_2220_2220"></a><a href="#Footnote_2220_2220" class="fnanchor">2220</a> one of lupi,<a id="FNanchor_2221_2221"></a><a href="#Footnote_2221_2221" class="fnanchor">2221</a> and a third of a
mixture of fish. It is clear that the public manners were
then already on the decline; though we still have a right to
hold them preferable to those of the philosophers even of
Greece, seeing that the representatives of Aristotle, it is said,
sold, at the auction of his goods, as many as seventy dishes of
earthenware. It has been already<a id="FNanchor_2222_2222"></a><a href="#Footnote_2222_2222" class="fnanchor">2222</a> stated by us, when on the
subject of birds, that a single dish cost the tragic actor √Üsopus
one hundred thousand sesterces; much to the reader‚Äôs indignation,
no doubt; but, by Hercules! Vitellius, when emperor,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>ordered a dish to be made, which was to cost a million of
sesterces, and for the preparation of which a furnace had to
be erected out in the fields! luxury having thus arrived at
such a pitch of excess as to make earthenware even sell at
higher prices than murrhine<a id="FNanchor_2223_2223"></a><a href="#Footnote_2223_2223" class="fnanchor">2223</a> vessels. It was in reference to
this circumstance, that Mucianus, in his second consulship,
when pronouncing one of his perorations, reproached the
memory of Vitellius with his dishes as broad as the Pomptine
Marsh; not less deserving to be execrated than the poisoned
dish of Asprenas, which, according to the accusation brought
against him by Cassius Severus, caused the death of one
hundred and thirty guests.<a id="FNanchor_2224_2224"></a><a href="#Footnote_2224_2224" class="fnanchor">2224</a></p>

<p>These works of artistic merit have conferred celebrity on
some cities even, Rhegium for example, and Cum√¶. The
priests of the Mother of the gods, known as the Galli, deprive
themselves of their virility with a piece of Samian<a id="FNanchor_2225_2225"></a><a href="#Footnote_2225_2225" class="fnanchor">2225</a> pottery,
the only means, if we believe M. C√¶lius,<a id="FNanchor_2226_2226"></a><a href="#Footnote_2226_2226" class="fnanchor">2226</a> of avoiding dangerous
results. He it was, too, who recommended, when inveighing
against certain abominable practices, that the person guilty of
them should have his tongue cut out, in a similar manner;
a reproach which would appear to have been levelled by anticipation
against this same Vitellius.</p>

<p>What is there that human industry will not devise? Even
broken pottery has been utilized; it being found that, beaten
to powder, and tempered with lime, it becomes more solid and
durable than other substances of a similar nature; forming the
cement known as the ‚ÄúSignine‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2227_2227"></a><a href="#Footnote_2227_2227" class="fnanchor">2227</a> composition, so extensively
employed for even making the pavements of houses.<a id="FNanchor_2228_2228"></a><a href="#Footnote_2228_2228" class="fnanchor">2228</a></p>

<p>But there are other resources also, which are derived immediately
from the earth. Who, indeed, cannot but be surprised
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>at finding the most inferior constituent parts of it, known as
‚Äúdust‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2229_2229"></a><a href="#Footnote_2229_2229" class="fnanchor">2229</a> only, on the hills about Puteoli, forming a barrier
against the waves of the sea, becoming changed into stone the
moment of its immersion, and increasing in hardness from day
to day‚Äîmore particularly when mixed with the cement of
Cum√¶? There is an earth too, of a similar nature found in
the districts about Cyzicus; but there, it is not a dust, but a
solid earth, which is cut away in blocks of all sizes, and which,
after being immersed in the sea, is taken out transformed into
stone. The same thing may be seen also, it is said, in the
vicinity of Cassandrea;<a id="FNanchor_2230_2230"></a><a href="#Footnote_2230_2230" class="fnanchor">2230</a> and at Cnidos, there is a spring of
fresh water which has the property of causing earth to petrify
within the space of eight months. Between Oropus and Aulis,
every portion of the land upon which the sea encroaches becomes
transformed into solid rock.</p>

<p>The finer portion of the sand of the river Nilus is not very
different in its properties from the dust of Puteoli; not, indeed,
that it is used for breaking the force of the sea and withstanding
the waves, but only for the purpose, forsooth, of subduing<a id="FNanchor_2231_2231"></a><a href="#Footnote_2231_2231" class="fnanchor">2231</a>
the body for the exercises of the palestra! At all events,
it was for this purpose that it used to be brought over for
Patrobius,<a id="FNanchor_2232_2232"></a><a href="#Footnote_2232_2232" class="fnanchor">2232</a> a freedman of the Emperor Nero. I find it stated
also, that Craterus, Leonnatus, and Meleager, generals of Alexander
the Great, had this sand transported along with their
munitions of war. But I forbear to enlarge any further upon
this subject; or indeed, by Hercules! upon those preparations
of earth and wax of which the ceromata are made, so much
employed by our youth in their exercises of the body, at the
cost of all vigour of the mind.</p>

Hannibal, and turrets of earth<a id="FNanchor_2234_2234"></a><a href="#Footnote_2234_2234" class="fnanchor">2234</a> placed on the very summits of

the substantial materials so well adapted for forming the
earth-works of our camps and embankments against the impetuous
violence of rivers. What person, too, is unacquainted

clay, and that walls are constructed of unbaked bricks?</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_49"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 49.‚ÄîWALLS OF BRICK. THE METHOD OF MAKING BRICKS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Earth for making bricks should never be extracted from a
sandy or gravelly soil, and still less from one that is stony;
but from a stratum that is white and cretaceous, or else impregnated
with red earth.<a id="FNanchor_2235_2235"></a><a href="#Footnote_2235_2235" class="fnanchor">2235</a> If a sandy soil must be employed
for the purpose, it should at least be male<a id="FNanchor_2236_2236"></a><a href="#Footnote_2236_2236" class="fnanchor">2236</a> sand, and no other.
The spring is the best season for making bricks, as at midsummer
they are very apt to crack. For building, bricks two
years old are the only ones that are approved of; and the
wrought material of them should be well macerated before
they are made.</p>

<p>There are three different kinds of bricks; the Lydian, which
is in use with us, a foot-and-a-half in length by a foot in
breadth; the tetradoron; and the pentadoron; the word ‚Äúdoron‚Äù
being used by the ancient Greeks to signify the palm<a id="FNanchor_2237_2237"></a><a href="#Footnote_2237_2237" class="fnanchor">2237</a>‚Äîhence,
too, their word ‚Äúdoron‚Äù meaning a gift, because it is the
hand that gives.‚ÄîThese last two kinds, therefore, are named
respectively from their being four and five palms in length,
the breadth being the same. The smaller kind is used in
Greece for private buildings, the larger for the construction of
public edifices. At Pitane,<a id="FNanchor_2238_2238"></a><a href="#Footnote_2238_2238" class="fnanchor">2238</a> in Asia, and in the cities of Muxilua
and Calentum in Farther Spain, there are bricks<a id="FNanchor_2239_2239"></a><a href="#Footnote_2239_2239" class="fnanchor">2239</a> made,
which float in water, when dry; the material being a sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>pumice-earth, extremely good for the purpose when it can be
made to unite. The Greeks have always preferred walls of
brick, except in those cases where they could find silicious
stone for the purposes of building: for walls of this nature
will last for ever, if they are only built on the perpendicular.
Hence it is, that the Greeks have built their public edifices and
the palaces of their kings of brick; the wall at Athens, for
example, which faces Mount Hymettus; the Temples of
Jupiter and Hercules at Patr√¶,<a id="FNanchor_2240_2240"></a><a href="#Footnote_2240_2240" class="fnanchor">2240</a> although the columns and
architraves in the interior are of stone; the palace of King
Attalus at Tralles; the palace of Cr≈ìsus at Sardes, now converted
into an asylum<a id="FNanchor_2241_2241"></a><a href="#Footnote_2241_2241" class="fnanchor">2241</a> for aged persons; and that of King
Mausolus at Halicarnassus; edifices, all of them, still in existence.</p>

<p>Mur√¶na and Varro, in their √¶dileship, had a fine fresco painting,
on the plaster of a wall at Laced√¶mon, cut away from
the bricks, and transported in wooden frames to Rome, for the
purpose of adorning the Comitium. Admirable as the work
was of itself, it was still more admired after being thus transferred.
In Italy also there are walls of brick, at Arretium
and Mevania.<a id="FNanchor_2242_2242"></a><a href="#Footnote_2242_2242" class="fnanchor">2242</a> At Rome, there are no buildings of this description,
because a wall only a foot-and-a-half in thickness
would not support more than a single story; and by public
ordinance it has been enacted that no partition should exceed
that thickness; nor, indeed, does the peculiar construction of
our party-walls admit of it.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_50"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 50. (15.)‚ÄîSULPHUR, AND THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT:
FOURTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Let thus much be deemed sufficient on the subject of bricks.
Among the other kinds of earth, the one of the most singular
nature, perhaps, is sulphur, an agent of great power upon other
substances. Sulphur is found in the √Üolian Islands, between
Sicily and Italy, which are volcanic, as already<a id="FNanchor_2243_2243"></a><a href="#Footnote_2243_2243" class="fnanchor">2243</a> stated. But
the finest sulphur of all, is that which comes from the Isle of
Melos. It is obtained also in Italy, upon the range of hills in
the territories of Neapolis and Campania, known as the Leucog√¶i:<a id="FNanchor_2244_2244"></a><a href="#Footnote_2244_2244" class="fnanchor">2244</a>
when extracted from the mines there, it is purified by
the agency of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>There are four kinds of sulphur; the first of which is ‚Äúlive‚Äù
sulphur, known as ‚Äúapyron‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2245_2245"></a><a href="#Footnote_2245_2245" class="fnanchor">2245</a> by the Greeks, and found in solid
masses, or in other words, in blocks. This, too, is the only sulphur
that is extracted in its native state, the others being found in a
state of liquescence, and requiring to be purified by being boiled
in oil. This kind is green and transparent, and is the only
sulphur that is used for medicinal purposes. A second kind is
known as the ‚Äúglebaceous‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2246_2246"></a><a href="#Footnote_2246_2246" class="fnanchor">2246</a> sulphur, and is solely employed in
the workshops of the fullers. The third kind, also, is only used
for a single purpose, that of fumigating wool, a process which
contributes very greatly to making the wool white and soft;
‚Äúegula‚Äù<a href="#Footnote_2246_2246" class="fnanchor">2246</a> is the name given to it. The fourth kind is used
in the preparation of matches more particularly.</p>

<p>In addition to these several uses, sulphur is of such remarkable
virtue, that if it is thrown upon the fire it will at once
detect, by the smell, whether or not a person is subject to
epilepsy. Anaxila√ºs used to employ this substance by way
of pastime: putting sulphur in a cup of wine, with some
hot coals beneath, he would hand it round to the guests, the
light given by it, while burning, throwing a ghastly paleness
like that of death upon the face of each. Its properties are calorific
and maturative, in addition to which, it disperses abscesses
on the body: hence it is that it is used as an ingredient in
plasters and emollient poultices. Applied to the loins and
kidneys, with grease, when there are pains in those parts, it
is marvellously effectual as a remedy. In combination with
turpentine, it removes lichens on the face, and leprosy,<a id="FNanchor_2247_2247"></a><a href="#Footnote_2247_2247" class="fnanchor">2247</a> the
preparation being known as ‚Äúharpax,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2248_2248"></a><a href="#Footnote_2248_2248" class="fnanchor">2248</a> from the celerity
with which it acts upon the skin; for which reason it ought to
be removed every now and then. Employed as an electuary, it is
good for asthma, purulent expectorations, and stings inflicted
by scorpions. Live sulphur, mixed with nitre, and then bruised
with vinegar and applied, causes morphew to disappear, and
destroys nits in the hair; in combination, too, with sandarach
and vinegar, it is good for diseases of the eyelids.</p>

<p>Sulphur has its place among our religious ceremonies, being
used as a fumigation for purifying houses.<a id="FNanchor_2249_2249"></a><a href="#Footnote_2249_2249" class="fnanchor">2249</a> Its virtues are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>also to be perceived in certain hot mineral waters;<a id="FNanchor_2250_2250"></a><a href="#Footnote_2250_2250" class="fnanchor">2250</a> and there
is no substance that ignites more readily, a proof that there is
in it a great affinity to fire. Lightning and thunder are attended
with a strong smell of sulphur, and the light produced
by them is of a sulphureous complexion.</p>

CHAP. 51.‚ÄîBITUMEN, AND THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT;
TWENTY-SEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Nearly approaching to the nature of sulphur is that of bitumen,<a id="FNanchor_2251_2251"></a><a href="#Footnote_2251_2251" class="fnanchor">2251</a>
which in some places assumes the form of a slime, and
in others that of an earth; a slime, thrown up, as already<a id="FNanchor_2252_2252"></a><a href="#Footnote_2252_2252" class="fnanchor">2252</a>
stated, by a certain lake in Jud√¶a, and an earth, found in the
vicinity of Sidon, a maritime town of Syria. In both these
states, it admits of being thickened and condensed. There
is also a liquid<a id="FNanchor_2253_2253"></a><a href="#Footnote_2253_2253" class="fnanchor">2253</a> bitumen, that of Zacynthus, for example, and
the bitumen that is imported from Babylon; which last kind
is also white: the bitumen, too, of Apollonia is liquid. All
these kinds, in Greek, have the one general name of ‚Äúpissasphaltos,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2254_2254"></a><a href="#Footnote_2254_2254" class="fnanchor">2254</a>
from their strong resemblance to a compound of
pitch and bitumen. There is also found an unctuous liquid
bitumen, resembling oil, in a spring at Agrigentum, in Sicily,
the waters of which are tainted by it. The inhabitants of the
spot collect it on the panicles of reeds, to which it very readily
adheres, and make use of it for burning in lamps, as a substitute
for oil, as also for the cure of itch-scab in beasts of
burden.</p>

<p>Some authorities include among the bitumens, naphtha, a substance
which we have already mentioned in the Second Book;<a id="FNanchor_2255_2255"></a><a href="#Footnote_2255_2255" class="fnanchor">2255</a>
but the burning properties which it possesses, and its susceptibility
of igniting, render it quite unfit for use. Bitumen,
to be of good quality, should be extremely brilliant, heavy,
and massive; it should also be moderately smooth, it being
very much the practice to adulterate it with pitch. Its medicinal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>properties are similar to those of sulphur, it being naturally
astringent, dispersive, contractive, and agglutinating: ignited,
it drives away serpents by the smell. Babylonian bitumen is
very efficacious, it is said, for the cure of cataract and albugo,
as also of leprosy, lichens, and pruriginous affections. Bitumen
is employed, too, in the form of a liniment, for gout; and
every variety of it is useful for making bandolines for eye-lashes
that are refractory and impede the sight. Applied topically
with nitre,<a id="FNanchor_2256_2256"></a><a href="#Footnote_2256_2256" class="fnanchor">2256</a> it is curative of tooth-ache, and, taken internally,
with wine, it alleviates chronic coughs and difficulty
of respiration. It is administered in a similar manner for
dysentery, and is very good for arresting looseness of the
bowels. Taken internally with vinegar, it dissolves and brings
away coagulated blood. It modifies pains also in the loins
and joints, and, applied with barley-meal, it forms a peculiar
kind of plaster, to which it has given its name.<a id="FNanchor_2257_2257"></a><a href="#Footnote_2257_2257" class="fnanchor">2257</a> It stanches
blood also, heals wounds, and unites the sinews when severed.
Bitumen is administered for quartan fevers, in doses of one
drachma to an equal quantity of hedyosmos,<a id="FNanchor_2258_2258"></a><a href="#Footnote_2258_2258" class="fnanchor">2258</a> the whole kneaded
up with one obolus of myrrh. The smell of burnt bitumen
detects a tendency to epilepsy, and, applied to the
nostrils with wine and castoreum,<a id="FNanchor_2259_2259"></a><a href="#Footnote_2259_2259" class="fnanchor">2259</a> it dispels suffocations of
the uterus. Employed as a fumigation, it acts as a check upon
procidence of the uterus, and, taken internally with wine, it
has the effect of an emmenagogue.</p>

<p>Another use that is made of it, is for coating the inside
of copper vessels, it rendering them proof against the action
of fire. It has been already<a id="FNanchor_2260_2260"></a><a href="#Footnote_2260_2260" class="fnanchor">2260</a> stated that bitumen was formerly
employed for staining copper and coating statues. It has been
used, too, as a substitute for lime; the walls of Babylon, for
instance, which are cemented with it. In the smithies they are
in the habit of varnishing iron and heads of nails with it, and
of using it for many other purposes as well.</p>

CHAP. 52.‚ÄîALUMEN, AND THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT;
THIRTY-EIGHT REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Not less important, or indeed very dissimilar, are the uses
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>that are made of alumen;<a id="FNanchor_2261_2261"></a><a href="#Footnote_2261_2261" class="fnanchor">2261</a> by which name is understood a
sort of brine<a id="FNanchor_2262_2262"></a><a href="#Footnote_2262_2262" class="fnanchor">2262</a> which exudes from the earth. Of this, too,
there are several kinds. In Cyprus there is a white alumen,
and another kind of a darker colour. The difference, however,
in their colour is but trifling in reality, though the uses made
of them are very dissimilar; the white liquid alumen being
employed for dyeing<a id="FNanchor_2263_2263"></a><a href="#Footnote_2263_2263" class="fnanchor">2263</a> wool of bright colours, and the black,
on the other hand, for giving wool a tawny or a sombre tint.
Gold, too, is purified<a id="FNanchor_2264_2264"></a><a href="#Footnote_2264_2264" class="fnanchor">2264</a> by the agency of black alumen. Every
kind of alumen is a compound of slime and water, or in other
words, is a liquid product exuding from the earth; the concretion
of it commencing in winter, and being completed by the
action of the summer sun. That portion of it which is the
first matured, is the whitest in appearance.</p>

<p>The countries which produce this substance, are Spain,
√Ügypt, Armenia, Macedonia, Pontus, Africa,<a id="FNanchor_2265_2265"></a><a href="#Footnote_2265_2265" class="fnanchor">2265</a> and the islands
of Sardinia, Melos, Lipara, and Strongyle:<a id="FNanchor_2266_2266"></a><a href="#Footnote_2266_2266" class="fnanchor">2266</a> the most esteemed,
however, is that of Egypt,<a id="FNanchor_2267_2267"></a><a href="#Footnote_2267_2267" class="fnanchor">2267</a> the next best being the
produce of Melos. Of this last kind there are also two
varieties, the liquid alumen, and the solid. Liquid alumen,
to be good, should be of a limpid, milky, appearance: when
rubbed between the fingers it should be free from grit, and
productive of a slight sensation of heat. The name given to it
is ‚Äúphorimon.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2268_2268"></a><a href="#Footnote_2268_2268" class="fnanchor">2268</a> The mode of detecting whether or not it has
been adulterated, is by the application of pomegranate-juice;
for if genuine, it will turn black on combining with the
juice. The other, or solid alumen, is pale and rough in appearance,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>and turns black on the application of nut-galls; for
which reason it is known by the name of ‚Äúparaphoron.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2269_2269"></a><a href="#Footnote_2269_2269" class="fnanchor">2269</a></p>

<p>Liquid alumen is naturally astringent, indurative, and corrosive:
used in combination with honey, it heals ulcerations of
the mouth, pimples, and pruriginous eruptions. The remedy,
when thus used, is employed in the bath, the proportions
being two parts of honey to one of alumen. It has the effect,
also, of checking and dispersing perspiration, and of neutralizing
offensive odours of the arm-pits. It is taken too, in
the form of pills, for affections of the spleen, and for the purpose
of carrying off blood by the urine: incorporated with nitre
and melanthium,<a id="FNanchor_2270_2270"></a><a href="#Footnote_2270_2270" class="fnanchor">2270</a> it is curative of itch-scab.</p>

<p>There is one kind of solid alumen, known to the Greeks as
‚Äúschiston,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2271_2271"></a><a href="#Footnote_2271_2271" class="fnanchor">2271</a> which splits into filaments of a whitish colour;
for which reason some have preferred giving it the name of
‚Äútrichitis.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2272_2272"></a><a href="#Footnote_2272_2272" class="fnanchor">2272</a> It is produced from the mineral ore known to
us as ‚Äúchalcitis,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2273_2273"></a><a href="#Footnote_2273_2273" class="fnanchor">2273</a> from which copper is also produced, it
being a sort of exudation from that mineral, coagulated into
the form of scum. This kind of alumen is less desiccative
than the others, and is not so useful as a check upon bad
humours of the body. Used, however, either in the form of a
liniment or of an injection, it is highly beneficial to the ears;
as also for ulcerations of the mouth, and for tooth-ache, if
retained with the saliva in the mouth. It is employed also
as a serviceable ingredient in compositions for the eyes, and
for the generative organs in either sex. The mode of preparing
it is to roast it in crucibles, until it has quite lost its
liquid form.</p>

<p>There is another variety of alumen also, of a less active nature,
and known as ‚Äústrongyle;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2274_2274"></a><a href="#Footnote_2274_2274" class="fnanchor">2274</a> which is again subdivided
into two kinds; the fungous, which easily dissolves in any
liquid, and is looked upon as altogether worthless; and the
porous, which is full of small holes like a sponge, and in
pieces of a globular form, more nearly approaching white
alumen in appearance. It has a certain degree, too, of unctuousness,
is free from grit, friable, and not apt to blacken the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>fingers. This last kind is calcined by itself upon hot coals,
unmixed with any other substance, until it is entirely reduced
to ashes.</p>

<p>The best kind of all, however, is that called ‚Äúmolinum,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2275_2275"></a><a href="#Footnote_2275_2275" class="fnanchor">2275</a>
as coming from the Isle of Melos, as already mentioned; none
being more effectual for acting as an astringent, staining
black, and indurating, and none assuming a closer consistency.
It removes granulations of the eye-lids, and, in a calcined state,
is still more efficacious for checking defluxions of the eyes:
in this last form, too, it is employed for the cure of pruriginous
eruptions on the body. Whether taken internally, or
employed externally, it arrests discharges of blood; and if it is
applied with vinegar to a part from which the hair has been
first removed, it will change into a soft down the hair which
replaces it. The leading property of every kind of alumen is
its remarkable astringency, to which, in fact, it is indebted for
its name<a id="FNanchor_2276_2276"></a><a href="#Footnote_2276_2276" class="fnanchor">2276</a> with the Greeks. It is for this property that the
various kinds are, all of them, so remarkably good for the
eyes. In combination with grease, they arrest discharges of
blood; and they are employed in a similar manner for checking
the spread of putrid ulcers, and for removing sores upon
the bodies of infants.</p>

<p>Alumen has a desiccative effect upon dropsical eruptions;
and, in combination with pomegranate juice, it removes diseases
of the ears, malformed nails, indurations resulting from
cicatrization, hangnails, and chilblains. Calcined, with vinegar
or nut-galls, in equal proportions, it is curative of phaged√¶nic
ulcers; and, in combination with extracted juice of
cabbage, of leprosy. Used in the proportion of one part of
alumen to two of salt, it arrests the progress of serpiginous
eruptions; and an infusion of it in water destroys lice and
other parasitical insects that infest the hair. Employed in a
similar manner, it is good for burns; and, in combination with
the serous<a id="FNanchor_2277_2277"></a><a href="#Footnote_2277_2277" class="fnanchor">2277</a> part of pitch, for furfuraceous eruptions on the
body. It is used also as an injection for dysentery, and, employed
in the form of a gargle, it braces the uvula and tonsillary
glands. For all those maladies which we have mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>as being treated with the other kinds of alumen, that
imported from Melos, be it understood, is still more efficacious.
As to the other uses that are made of it for industrial purposes,
such as preparing hides and wool, for example, they
have been mentioned already.<a id="FNanchor_2278_2278"></a><a href="#Footnote_2278_2278" class="fnanchor">2278</a></p>

<p>Of Samian earth there are two varieties; one known as

perfection, the first kind should be fresh, remarkably smooth,
and glutinous to the tongue; the second being of a more
solid consistency, and white. They are both prepared for use
by being calcined and then rinsed in water, some persons
giving the preference to the first. They are both of them
useful for discharges of blood from the mouth, and are employed
as an ingredient in plasters of a desiccative nature.
They are used also in the preparation of ophthalmic compositions.</p>

of varieties; one white, and the other of an ashy colour, this
last being preferred in medicine. To be good, this earth
should be of a soft consistency, and when rubbed upon copper
it should leave a violet tint. The virtues of eretria in a medicinal

<p>Among the medicinal substances, there is the white earth of
Chios also, the properties of which are the same as those of
Samian earth. It is used more particularly as a cosmetic for
the skin of females; the Selinusian<a id="FNanchor_2284_2284"></a><a href="#Footnote_2284_2284" class="fnanchor">2284</a> earth being also employed
for a similar purpose. This last is of a milk-white colour,
and melts very rapidly in water: dissolved in milk, it is employed
for whitening the plaster coats on walls. Pnigitis<a id="FNanchor_2285_2285"></a><a href="#Footnote_2285_2285" class="fnanchor">2285</a> is
very similar to Eretrian earth, only that it is found in larger
masses, and is of a glutinous consistency. Its effects are
similar to those produced by Cimolian<a id="FNanchor_2286_2286"></a><a href="#Footnote_2286_2286" class="fnanchor">2286</a> earth, but are not so
energetic.</p>

<p>Ampelitis<a id="FNanchor_2287_2287"></a><a href="#Footnote_2287_2287" class="fnanchor">2287</a> is an earth which bears a strong resemblance to
bitumen. The test of its goodness is its dissolving in oil, like
wax, and preserving its black colour when submitted to the
action of fire. Its properties are emollient and repercussive;
for which reason, it is used in medicinal compositions, those
known as ‚Äúcalliblephara,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2288_2288"></a><a href="#Footnote_2288_2288" class="fnanchor">2288</a> more particularly, and in preparations

<p>Of cretaceous<a id="FNanchor_2289_2289"></a><a href="#Footnote_2289_2289" class="fnanchor">2289</a> earths there are several varieties; and among
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>them, two kinds of Cimolian earth, employed in medicine, the
one white and the other inclining to the tint of purpurissum.<a id="FNanchor_2290_2290"></a><a href="#Footnote_2290_2290" class="fnanchor">2290</a>
Both kinds, moistened with vinegar, have the effect of dispersing
tumours and arresting defluxions. They are curative
also of inflammatory swellings and imposthumes of the parotid
glands; and, applied topically, they are good for affections of
the spleen and pustules on the body. With the addition of
aphronitrum,<a id="FNanchor_2291_2291"></a><a href="#Footnote_2291_2291" class="fnanchor">2291</a> oil of cypros,<a id="FNanchor_2292_2292"></a><a href="#Footnote_2292_2292" class="fnanchor">2292</a> and vinegar, they reduce
swellings of the feet, care being taken to apply the lotion in
the sun, and at the end of six hours to wash it off with salt
and water. In combination with wax and oil of cypros,
Cimolian earth is good for swellings of the testes.</p>

<p>Cretaceous earths, too, are of a cooling tendency, and,
applied to the body in the form of a liniment, they act as a
check upon excessive perspiration: taken with wine, in the
bath, they remove pimples on the body. The most esteemed
of all these earths is that of Thessaly: it is found also in the
vicinity of Bubon<a id="FNanchor_2293_2293"></a><a href="#Footnote_2293_2293" class="fnanchor">2293</a> in Lycia.</p>

<p>Cimolian earth is used also for another purpose, that of
scouring cloth. As to the kind which is brought from Sardinia,
and is known as ‚Äúsarda,‚Äù it is used for white tissues
only, and is never employed for coloured cloths. Indeed, this
last is held in the lowest estimation of all the Cimolian earths;
whereas, that of Umbria is more highly esteemed, as also the
kind generally known as ‚Äúsaxum.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2294_2294"></a><a href="#Footnote_2294_2294" class="fnanchor">2294</a> It is a property of
this last to increase in weight<a id="FNanchor_2295_2295"></a><a href="#Footnote_2295_2295" class="fnanchor">2295</a> by maceration, and it is by
weight that it is usually sold, Sardinian earth being sold by
measure. Umbrian earth is only used for giving lustre to
cloths.</p>

<p>It will not be deemed out of place to give some further
account here of this process, there being still in existence the
Metilian Law, relative to fullers; an enactment which C.
Flaminius and L. √Ümilius, in their censorship,<a id="FNanchor_2296_2296"></a><a href="#Footnote_2296_2296" class="fnanchor">2296</a> had passed by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>the people,<a id="FNanchor_2297_2297"></a><a href="#Footnote_2297_2297" class="fnanchor">2297</a> so attentive to everything were our ancestors.
The following then is the method employed in preparing
cloth: it is first washed in an infusion of Sardinian earth, and
is then exposed to a fumigation with sulphur. This done, it is
scoured<a id="FNanchor_2298_2298"></a><a href="#Footnote_2298_2298" class="fnanchor">2298</a> with Cimolian earth, when the cloth has been found
to be of a genuine colour; it being very soon detected when it
has been coloured with spurious materials, by its turning
black and the colours becoming dispersed<a id="FNanchor_2299_2299"></a><a href="#Footnote_2299_2299" class="fnanchor">2299</a> by the action of the
sulphur. Where the colours are genuine and rich, they are
softened by the application of Cimolian earth; which brightens
and freshens them also when they have been rendered sombre
by the action of the sulphur. Saxum is better for white tissues,
after the application of sulphur, but to coloured cloths it is
highly injurious.<a id="FNanchor_2300_2300"></a><a href="#Footnote_2300_2300" class="fnanchor">2300</a> In Greece they use Tymph√¶an<a id="FNanchor_2301_2301"></a><a href="#Footnote_2301_2301" class="fnanchor">2301</a> gypsum in

over in the same ship.<a id="FNanchor_2307_2307"></a><a href="#Footnote_2307_2307" class="fnanchor">2307</a></p>

<p>(18.) But why mention these names, recommended as they are
by the literary honours which they acquired? Other instances
too, Rome has beheld of persons rising to high positions from
the slave-market;<a id="FNanchor_2308_2308"></a><a href="#Footnote_2308_2308" class="fnanchor">2308</a> Chrysogonus, for example, the freedman
of Sylla; Amphion, the freedman of Q. Catulus; the man who
was the keeper<a id="FNanchor_2309_2309"></a><a href="#Footnote_2309_2309" class="fnanchor">2309</a> of Lucullus; Demetrius, the freedman of Pompeius,
and Auge, the freedwoman of Demetrius,<a id="FNanchor_2310_2310"></a><a href="#Footnote_2310_2310" class="fnanchor">2310</a> or else of
Pompeius himself, as some have supposed; Hipparchus, the
freedman of M. Antonius; as also, Menas<a id="FNanchor_2311_2311"></a><a href="#Footnote_2311_2311" class="fnanchor">2311</a> and Menecrates,<a id="FNanchor_2312_2312"></a><a href="#Footnote_2312_2312" class="fnanchor">2312</a>
freedmen of Sextus Pompeius, and many others as well, whom
it would be superfluous to enumerate, and who have enriched
themselves at the cost of Roman blood, and the licence that
results from proscription.</p>

<p>Such is the mark that is set upon those droves of slaves
which we see on sale, such the opprobrium thrown upon them
by a capricious fortune! And yet, some of these very men have
we beheld in the enjoyment of such power and influence, that
the senate itself has decreed them‚Äîat the command of Agrippina,<a id="FNanchor_2313_2313"></a><a href="#Footnote_2313_2313" class="fnanchor">2313</a>
wife of the Emperor Claudius‚Äîthe decorations even of
the pr√¶torship: all but honoured with the fasces and their
laurels, in fact, and sent back in state to the very place from
which they originally came, with their feet whitened with the
slave-dealer‚Äôs chalk!</p>

<h3 class="section nobreak" id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_1"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 1. (1.)‚ÄîLUXURY DISPLAYED IN THE USE OF VARIOUS KINDS
OF MARBLE.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> now remains for us to speak of stones, or, in other words,
the leading folly of the day; to say nothing at all of our taste
for gems and amber, crystal and murrhine vases.<a id="FNanchor_2352_2352"></a><a href="#Footnote_2352_2352" class="fnanchor">2352</a> For everything
of which we have previously treated, down to the
present Book, may, by some possibility or other, have the appearance
of having been created for the sake of man: but as
to the mountains, Nature has made those for herself, as a kind
of bulwark for keeping together the bowels of the earth; as
also for the purpose of curbing the violence of the rivers, of
breaking the waves of the sea, and so, by opposing to them
the very hardest of her materials, putting a check upon those
elements which are never at rest. And yet we must hew
down these mountains, forsooth, and carry them off; and this,
for no other reason than to gratify our luxurious inclinations:
heights which in former days it was reckoned a miracle even to
have crossed!</p>

<p>Our forefathers regarded as a prodigy the passage of the
Alps, first by Hannibal,<a id="FNanchor_2353_2353"></a><a href="#Footnote_2353_2353" class="fnanchor">2353</a> and, more recently, by the Cimbri:
but at the present day, these very mountains are cut asunder
to yield us a thousand different marbles, promontories are
thrown open to the sea, and the face of Nature is being everywhere
reduced to a level. We now carry away the barriers
that were destined for the separation of one nation from
another; we construct ships for the transport of our marbles;
and, amid the waves, the most boisterous element of Nature,
we convey the summits of the mountains to and fro: a thing,
however, that is even less unpardonable than to go on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>search amid the regions of the clouds for vessels<a id="FNanchor_2354_2354"></a><a href="#Footnote_2354_2354" class="fnanchor">2354</a> with which
to cool our draughts, and to excavate rocks, towering to the
very heavens, in order that we may have the satisfaction of
drinking from ice! Let each reflect, when he hears of the
high prices set upon these things, when he sees these ponderous
masses carted and carried away, how many there are whose
life is passed far more happily without them. For what
utility or for what so-called pleasure do mortals make themselves
the agents, or, more truly speaking, the victims of such
undertakings, except in order that others may take their repose
in the midst of variegated stones? Just as though too, the
shades of night, which occupy one half of each man‚Äôs existence,
would forbear to curtail these imaginary delights.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_2"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 2.‚ÄîWHO WAS THE FIRST TO EMPLOY MARBLE IN PUBLIC
BUILDINGS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Indeed, while making these reflections, one cannot but feel
ashamed of the men of ancient times even. There are still in
existence censorial<a id="FNanchor_2355_2355"></a><a href="#Footnote_2355_2355" class="fnanchor">2355</a> laws, which forbid the kernels<a id="FNanchor_2356_2356"></a><a href="#Footnote_2356_2356" class="fnanchor">2356</a> in the
neck of swine to be served at table, dormice too, and other
things too trifling to mention: and yet there has been no law
passed, forbidding marble to be imported, or the seas to be
traversed in search of it!</p>

<p>(2.) It may possibly be observed, that this was, because
marble was not then introduced. Such, however, is not the
fact; for in the √¶dileship of M. Scaurus,<a id="FNanchor_2357_2357"></a><a href="#Footnote_2357_2357" class="fnanchor">2357</a> three hundred and
sixty columns were to be seen imported; for the decorations of
a temporary theatre, too, one that was destined to be in use for
barely a single month. And yet the laws were silent thereon;
in a spirit of indulgence for the amusements of the public, no
doubt. But then, why such indulgence or how do vices
more insidiously steal upon us than under the plea of serving
the public? By what other way, in fact, did ivory, gold, and
precious stones, first come into use with private individuals?</p>

<p>Can we say that there is now anything that we have reserved
for the exclusive use of the gods? However, be it so,
let us admit of this indulgence for the amusements of the
public; but still, why did the laws maintain their silence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>when the largest of these columns, pillars of Lucullan<a id="FNanchor_2358_2358"></a><a href="#Footnote_2358_2358" class="fnanchor">2358</a> marble,
as much as eight-and-thirty feet in height, were erected in
the atrium of Scaurus? a thing, too, that was not done
privately or in secret; for the contractor for the public sewers
compelled him to give security for the possible damage that
might be done in the carriage of them to the Palatium.<a id="FNanchor_2359_2359"></a><a href="#Footnote_2359_2359" class="fnanchor">2359</a>
When so bad an example as this was set, would it not have
been advisable to take some precautions for the preservation
of the public morals? And yet the laws still preserved their
silence, when such enormous masses as these were being carried
past the earthenware<a id="FNanchor_2360_2360"></a><a href="#Footnote_2360_2360" class="fnanchor">2360</a> pediments of the temples of the
gods, to the house of a private individual!</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_3"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 3. (3.)‚ÄîWHO WAS THE FIRST TO ERECT COLUMNS OF
FOREIGN MARBLE AT ROME.</span></h3></div>

<p>And yet it cannot be said that Scaurus, by way of a first
essay in vice, took the City by surprise, in a state of ignorance
and totally unguarded against such evils as these. Already
had L. Crassus,<a id="FNanchor_2361_2361"></a><a href="#Footnote_2361_2361" class="fnanchor">2361</a> the orator, he who was the first to possess
pillars of foreign marble, and in this same Palatium too, received
from M. Brutus, on the occasion of a dispute, the nickname
of the ‚ÄúPalatine Venus,‚Äù for his indulgence in this
kind of luxury. The material, I should remark, was Hymettian
marble, and the pillars were but six in number, and not
exceeding some twelve feet in height. Our forefathers were
guilty of this omission, no doubt, because morals were universally
contaminated; and, seeing that things which had been interdicted
had been forbidden in vain, they preferred the absence
of laws to laws that were no better than a dead letter. These
particulars and others in the sequel will show that we are so
far improved; for who is there at the present day that has, in
his atrium, any such massive columns as these of Scaurus?</p>

<p>But before proceeding to treat of the several varieties of this
material, it will be as well to mention the various artists, and
the degrees of estimation in which they are held, who have
worked in marble. We will, therefore, proceed to review the
sculptors who have flourished at different periods.</p>

OF MARBLE, AND THE VARIOUS PERIODS AT WHICH THEY
FLOURISHED. THE MAUSOLEUM IN CARIA. THE MOST CELEBRATED
SCULPTORS AND WORKS IN MARBLE, TWO HUNDRED AND
TWENTY-FIVE IN NUMBER.</span></h3></div>

<p>The first artists who distinguished themselves in the sculpture
of marble, were Dip≈ìnus<a id="FNanchor_2362_2362"></a><a href="#Footnote_2362_2362" class="fnanchor">2362</a> and Scyllis, natives of the Isle
of Crete. At this period the Medians were still in power, and
Cyrus had not begun to reign in Persia; their date being about
the fiftieth Olympiad. They afterwards repaired to Sicyon, a
state which for a length of time<a id="FNanchor_2363_2363"></a><a href="#Footnote_2363_2363" class="fnanchor">2363</a> was the adopted country of
all such pursuits as these. The people of Sicyon had made a
contract with them for the execution of certain statues of the
gods; but, before completing the work, the artists complained
of some injustice being done them, and retired to √Ütolia. Immediately
upon this, the state was afflicted with sterility and
famine, and dreadful consternation was the result. Upon
enquiry being made as to a remedy for these evils, the Pythian
Apollo made answer, that Dip≈ìnus and Scyllis must complete
the statues of the gods; an object which was attained at the
cost of great concessions and considerable sums of money.
The statues were those of Apollo,<a id="FNanchor_2364_2364"></a><a href="#Footnote_2364_2364" class="fnanchor">2364</a> Diana, Hercules, and
Minerva; the last of which was afterwards struck by
lightning.</p>

<p>(5.) Before these artists were in existence, there had already
appeared Melas, a sculptor of the Isle of Chios; and, in succession
to him, his son Micciades, and his grandson Archermus;<a id="FNanchor_2365_2365"></a><a href="#Footnote_2365_2365" class="fnanchor">2365</a>
whose sons, Bupalus and Athenis, afterwards attained the highest
eminence in the art. These last were contemporaries of the
poet Hipponax, who, it is well known, lived in the sixtieth
Olympiad. Now, if a person only reckons, going upwards
from their time to that of their great-grandfather, he will find
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>that the art of sculpture must have necessarily originated about
the commencement of the era of the Olympiads. Hipponax
being a man notorious for his ugliness, the two artists, by way
of joke,<a id="FNanchor_2366_2366"></a><a href="#Footnote_2366_2366" class="fnanchor">2366</a> exhibited a statue of him for the ridicule of the public.
Indignant at this, the poet emptied upon them all the
bitterness of his verses; to such an extent indeed, that, as
some believe, they were driven to hang themselves in despair.
This, however, is not the fact; for, at a later period, these
artists executed a number of statues in the neighbouring islands;
at Delos for example, with an inscription subjoined to the effect,
that Chios was rendered famous not only by its vines<a id="FNanchor_2367_2367"></a><a href="#Footnote_2367_2367" class="fnanchor">2367</a> but by
the works of the sons of Archermus as well. The people of
Lasos<a id="FNanchor_2368_2368"></a><a href="#Footnote_2368_2368" class="fnanchor">2368</a> still show a Diana that was made by them; and we
find mention also made of a Diana at Chios, the work of their
hands: it is erected on an elevated spot, and the features appear
stern to a person as he enters, and joyous as he departs.
At Rome, there are some statues by these artists on the summit
of the Temple<a id="FNanchor_2369_2369"></a><a href="#Footnote_2369_2369" class="fnanchor">2369</a> of the Palatine Apollo, and, indeed, in most of
the buildings that were erected by the late Emperor Augustus.
At Delos and in the Isle of Lesbos there were formerly some
sculptures by their father to be seen. Ambracia too, Argos,
and Cleon√¶, were filled with productions of the sculptor Dip≈ìnus.</p>

<p>All these artists, however, used nothing but the white marble
of the Isle of Paros, a stone which was known as ‚Äúlychnites‚Äù
at first, because, according to Varro, it was cut in the quarries
by lamplight.<a id="FNanchor_2370_2370"></a><a href="#Footnote_2370_2370" class="fnanchor">2370</a> Since their time, many other whiter marbles
have been discovered, and very recently that of the quarries
of Luna.<a id="FNanchor_2371_2371"></a><a href="#Footnote_2371_2371" class="fnanchor">2371</a> With reference to the marble of Paros, there is one
very marvellous circumstance related; in a single block that
was split with wedges, a figure<a id="FNanchor_2372_2372"></a><a href="#Footnote_2372_2372" class="fnanchor">2372</a> of Silenus made its appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>We must not omit to remark, that the art of sculpture is
of much more ancient<a id="FNanchor_2373_2373"></a><a href="#Footnote_2373_2373" class="fnanchor">2373</a> date than those of painting and of
statuary in bronze; both of which commenced with Phidias,
in the eighty-third Olympiad, or in other words, about
three hundred and thirty-two years later. Indeed, it is said,
that Phidias himself worked in marble, and that there is a
Venus of his at Rome, a work of extraordinary beauty, in the
buildings of Octavia.<a id="FNanchor_2374_2374"></a><a href="#Footnote_2374_2374" class="fnanchor">2374</a> A thing, however, that is universally
admitted, is the fact that he was the instructor of Alcamenes,<a id="FNanchor_2375_2375"></a><a href="#Footnote_2375_2375" class="fnanchor">2375</a>
the Athenian, one of the most famous among the sculptors.
By this last artist, there are numerous statues in the temples
at Athens; as also, without the walls there, the celebrated
Venus, known as the Aphrodite <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">·ºêŒΩ Œ∫·ΩµœÄŒøŒπœÇ</span>,<a id="FNanchor_2376_2376"></a><a href="#Footnote_2376_2376" class="fnanchor">2376</a> work to which
Phidias himself, it is said, put the finishing hand. Another
disciple also of Phidias was Agoracritus<a id="FNanchor_2377_2377"></a><a href="#Footnote_2377_2377" class="fnanchor">2377</a> of Paros, a great
favourite with his master, on account of his extremely youthful
age; and for which reason, it is said, Phidias gave his own name
to many of that artist‚Äôs works. The two pupils entering into a
contest as to the superior execution of a statue of Venus,
Alcamenes was successful; not that his work was superior, but
because his fellow-citizens chose to give their suffrages in his
favour in preference to a stranger. It was for this reason, it
is said, that Agoracritus sold his statue, on the express condition
that it should never be taken to Athens, and changed its
name to that of Nemesis.<a id="FNanchor_2378_2378"></a><a href="#Footnote_2378_2378" class="fnanchor">2378</a> It was accordingly erected at
Rhamnus,<a id="FNanchor_2379_2379"></a><a href="#Footnote_2379_2379" class="fnanchor">2379</a> a borough of Attica, and M. Varro has considered
it superior to every other statue. There is also to be seen in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>the Temple of the Great Mother, in the same city, another
work<a id="FNanchor_2380_2380"></a><a href="#Footnote_2380_2380" class="fnanchor">2380</a> by Agoracritus.</p>

<p>Among all nations which the fame of the Olympian Jupiter
has reached, Phidias is looked upon, beyond all doubt, as
the most famous of artists: but to let those who have never
even seen his works, know how deservedly he is esteemed,
we will take this opportunity of adducing a few slight proofs
of the genius which he displayed. In doing this, we shall
not appeal to the beauty of his Olympian Jupiter, nor yet to
the vast proportions of his Athenian Minerva, six and twenty
cubits in height, and composed of ivory and gold; but it is to
the shield of this last statue that we shall draw attention;
upon the convex face of which he has chased a combat of the
Amazons, while, upon the concave side of it, he has represented
the battle between the Gods and the Giants. Upon
the sandals again, we see the wars of the Lapith√¶ and
Centaurs, so careful has he been to fill every smallest portion
of his work with some proof or other of his artistic skill. To
the story chased upon the pedestal of the statue, the name of
the ‚ÄúBirth of Pandora‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2381_2381"></a><a href="#Footnote_2381_2381" class="fnanchor">2381</a> has been given; and the figures
of new-born<a id="FNanchor_2382_2382"></a><a href="#Footnote_2382_2382" class="fnanchor">2382</a> gods to be seen upon it are no less than twenty
in number. The figure of Victory, in particular, is most
admirable, and connoisseurs are greatly struck with the serpent
and the sphinx in bronze lying beneath the point of
the spear. Let thus much be said incidentally in reference to
an artist who can never be sufficiently praised; if only to let
it be understood that the richness of his genius was always
equal to itself, even in the very smallest details.</p>

<p>When speaking<a id="FNanchor_2383_2383"></a><a href="#Footnote_2383_2383" class="fnanchor">2383</a> of the statuaries, we have already given
the period at which Praxiteles flourished; an artist, who, in
the glory which he acquired by his works in marble, surpassed
even himself. There are some works of his in the
Ceramicus<a id="FNanchor_2384_2384"></a><a href="#Footnote_2384_2384" class="fnanchor">2384</a> at Athens; but, superior to all the statues, not
only of Praxiteles, but of any other artist that ever existed,
is his Cnidian Venus; for the inspection of which, many persons
before now have purposely undertaken a voyage to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>Cnidos. The artist made two statues of the goddess, and
offered them both for sale: one of them was represented
with drapery,<a id="FNanchor_2385_2385"></a><a href="#Footnote_2385_2385" class="fnanchor">2385</a> and for this reason was preferred<a id="FNanchor_2386_2386"></a><a href="#Footnote_2386_2386" class="fnanchor">2386</a> by the people
of Cos, who had the choice; the second was offered them at
the same price, but, on the grounds of propriety and modesty,
they thought fit to choose the other. Upon this, the Cnidians
purchased the rejected statue,<a id="FNanchor_2387_2387"></a><a href="#Footnote_2387_2387" class="fnanchor">2387</a> and immensely superior has it
always been held in general estimation. At a later period,
King Nicomedes wished to purchase this statue of the Cnidians,
and made them an offer to pay off the whole of their
public debt, which was very large. They preferred, however,
to submit to any extremity rather than part with it; and with
good reason, for by this statue Praxiteles has perpetuated the
glory of Cnidos. The little temple in which it is placed is
open on all sides, so that the beauties<a id="FNanchor_2388_2388"></a><a href="#Footnote_2388_2388" class="fnanchor">2388</a> of the statue admit of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>being seen from every point of view; an arrangement which
was favoured by the goddess herself, it is generally believed.
Indeed, from whatever point it is viewed, its execution is
equally worthy of admiration. A certain individual, it is
said, became enamoured of this statue, and, concealing himself
in the temple during the night, gratified his lustful passion
upon it, traces of which are to be seen in a stain left upon
the marble.<a id="FNanchor_2389_2389"></a><a href="#Footnote_2389_2389" class="fnanchor">2389</a></p>

<p>There are also at Cnidos some other statues in marble, the
productions of illustrious artists; a Father Liber<a id="FNanchor_2390_2390"></a><a href="#Footnote_2390_2390" class="fnanchor">2390</a> by Bryaxis,<a id="FNanchor_2391_2391"></a><a href="#Footnote_2391_2391" class="fnanchor">2391</a>
another by Scopas,<a id="FNanchor_2392_2392"></a><a href="#Footnote_2392_2392" class="fnanchor">2392</a> and a Minerva by the same hand: indeed,
there is no greater proof of the supreme excellence of the
Venus of Praxiteles than the fact that, amid such productions
as these, it is the only one that we generally find noticed.
By Praxiteles, too, there is a Cupid, a statue which occasioned<a id="FNanchor_2393_2393"></a><a href="#Footnote_2393_2393" class="fnanchor">2393</a>
one of the charges brought by Cicero against Verres,
and for the sake of seeing which persons used to visit Thespi√¶:
at the present day, it is to be seen in the Schools<a id="FNanchor_2394_2394"></a><a href="#Footnote_2394_2394" class="fnanchor">2394</a> of Octavia.
By the same artist there is also another Cupid, without
drapery, at Parium, a colony of the Propontis; equal to the
Cnidian Venus in the fineness of its execution, and said to have
been the object of a similar outrage. For one Alcetas, a
Rhodian, becoming deeply enamoured of it, left upon the
marble similar traces of the violence of his passion.</p>

<p>At Rome there are, by Praxiteles, a Flora, a Triptolemus,
and a Ceres, in the Gardens of Servilius; statues of Good
Success<a id="FNanchor_2395_2395"></a><a href="#Footnote_2395_2395" class="fnanchor">2395</a> and Good Fortune, in the Capitol; as also some
M√¶nades,<a id="FNanchor_2396_2396"></a><a href="#Footnote_2396_2396" class="fnanchor">2396</a> and figures known as Thyiades<a id="FNanchor_2397_2397"></a><a href="#Footnote_2397_2397" class="fnanchor">2397</a> and Caryatides;<a id="FNanchor_2398_2398"></a><a href="#Footnote_2398_2398" class="fnanchor">2398</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>some Sileni,<a id="FNanchor_2399_2399"></a><a href="#Footnote_2399_2399" class="fnanchor">2399</a> to be seen in the memorial buildings of Asinius
Pollio, and statues of Apollo and Neptune.</p>

<p>Cephisodotus,<a id="FNanchor_2400_2400"></a><a href="#Footnote_2400_2400" class="fnanchor">2400</a> the son of Praxiteles, inherited his father‚Äôs
talent. There is, by him, at Pergamus, a splendid Group<a id="FNanchor_2401_2401"></a><a href="#Footnote_2401_2401" class="fnanchor">2401</a> of
Wrestlers, a work that has been highly praised, and in which
the fingers have all the appearance of being impressed upon
real flesh rather than upon marble. At Rome there are by
him, a Latona, in the Temple of the Palatium; a Venus, in the
buildings that are memorials of Asinius Pollio; and an √Üsculapius,
and a Diana, in the Temple of Juno situate within
the Porticos of Octavia.</p>

<p>Scopas<a id="FNanchor_2402_2402"></a><a href="#Footnote_2402_2402" class="fnanchor">2402</a> rivals these artists in fame: there are by him, a
Venus<a id="FNanchor_2403_2403"></a><a href="#Footnote_2403_2403" class="fnanchor">2403</a> and a Pothos,<a id="FNanchor_2404_2404"></a><a href="#Footnote_2404_2404" class="fnanchor">2404</a> statues which are venerated at Samothrace
with the most august ceremonials. He was also the
sculptor of the Palatine Apollo; a Vesta seated, in the Gardens
of Servilius, and represented with two Bends<a id="FNanchor_2405_2405"></a><a href="#Footnote_2405_2405" class="fnanchor">2405</a> around her, a
work that has been highly praised; two similar Bends, to be
seen upon the buildings of Asinius Pollio; and some figures of
Canephori<a id="FNanchor_2406_2406"></a><a href="#Footnote_2406_2406" class="fnanchor">2406</a> in the same place. But the most highly esteemed
of all his works, are those in the Temple erected by Cneius
Domitius,<a id="FNanchor_2407_2407"></a><a href="#Footnote_2407_2407" class="fnanchor">2407</a> in the Flaminian Circus; a figure of Neptune
himself, a Thetis and Achilles, Nereids seated upon dolphins,
cetaceous fishes, and<a id="FNanchor_2408_2408"></a><a href="#Footnote_2408_2408" class="fnanchor">2408</a> sea-horses,<a id="FNanchor_2409_2409"></a><a href="#Footnote_2409_2409" class="fnanchor">2409</a> Tritons, the train of Phorcus,<a id="FNanchor_2410_2410"></a><a href="#Footnote_2410_2410" class="fnanchor">2410</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>whales,<a id="FNanchor_2411_2411"></a><a href="#Footnote_2411_2411" class="fnanchor">2411</a> and numerous other sea-monsters, all by the
same hand; an admirable piece of workmanship, even if it had
taken a whole life to complete it. In addition to the works
by him already mentioned, and others of the existence of
which we are ignorant, there is still to be seen a colossal Mars
of his, seated, in the Temple erected by Brutus Call√¶cus,<a id="FNanchor_2412_2412"></a><a href="#Footnote_2412_2412" class="fnanchor">2412</a>
also in the Flaminian Circus; as also, a naked Venus, of anterior
date to that by Praxiteles, and a production that would
be quite sufficient to establish the renown of any other place.</p>

<p>At Rome, it is true, it is quite lost sight of amid such a vast
multitude of similar works of art: and then besides, the inattention
to these matters that is induced by such vast numbers
of duties and so many items of business, quite precludes the
generality of persons from devoting their thoughts to the
subject. For, in fact, the admiration that is due to this art,
not only demands an abundance of leisure, but requires that
profound silence should reign upon the spot. Hence it is,
that the artist is now forgotten, who executed the statue of
Venus that was dedicated by the Emperor Vespasianus in his
Temple of Peace, a work well worthy of the high repute of
ancient times. With reference, too, to the Dying Children of
Niobe, in the Temple of the Sosian<a id="FNanchor_2413_2413"></a><a href="#Footnote_2413_2413" class="fnanchor">2413</a> Apollo, there is an equal
degree of uncertainty, whether it is the work<a id="FNanchor_2414_2414"></a><a href="#Footnote_2414_2414" class="fnanchor">2414</a> of Scopas or of
Praxiteles. So, too, as to the Father Janus, a work that was
brought from Egypt and dedicated in his Temple<a id="FNanchor_2415_2415"></a><a href="#Footnote_2415_2415" class="fnanchor">2415</a> by Augustus,
it is a question by which of these two artists<a id="FNanchor_2416_2416"></a><a href="#Footnote_2416_2416" class="fnanchor">2416</a> it was made:
at the present day, however, it is quite hidden from us by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>quantity of gold that covers it. The same question, too,
arises with reference to the Cupid brandishing a Thunderbolt,
now to be seen in the Curia of Octavia: the only thing, in
fact, that is affirmed with any degree of certainty respecting
it, is, that it is a likeness of Alcibiades, who was the handsomest
man of his day. There are, too, in the Schools<a id="FNanchor_2417_2417"></a><a href="#Footnote_2417_2417" class="fnanchor">2417</a> of
Octavia, many other highly attractive works, the authors of
which are now unknown: four Satyrs, for example, one of
which carries in his arms a Father Liber, robed in the palla;<a id="FNanchor_2418_2418"></a><a href="#Footnote_2418_2418" class="fnanchor">2418</a>
another similarly supports the Goddess Libera;<a id="FNanchor_2419_2419"></a><a href="#Footnote_2419_2419" class="fnanchor">2419</a> a third is
pacifying a child who is crying; and a fourth is giving a child
some water to drink, from a cup; two Zephyrs also, who
agitate their flowing drapery with their breath. No less is
the uncertainty that prevails as to the authors of the statues
now to be seen in the Septa;<a id="FNanchor_2420_2420"></a><a href="#Footnote_2420_2420" class="fnanchor">2420</a> an Olympus<a id="FNanchor_2421_2421"></a><a href="#Footnote_2421_2421" class="fnanchor">2421</a> and Pan, and a
Charon and Achilles;<a id="FNanchor_2422_2422"></a><a href="#Footnote_2422_2422" class="fnanchor">2422</a> and yet their high reputation has
caused them to be deemed valuable enough for their keepers
to be made answerable for their safety at the cost of their lives.</p>

<p>Scopas had for rivals and contemporaries, Bryaxis,<a id="FNanchor_2423_2423"></a><a href="#Footnote_2423_2423" class="fnanchor">2423</a> Timotheus,<a id="FNanchor_2424_2424"></a><a href="#Footnote_2424_2424" class="fnanchor">2424</a>
and Leochares,<a id="FNanchor_2425_2425"></a><a href="#Footnote_2425_2425" class="fnanchor">2425</a> artists whom we are bound to mention
together, from the fact that they worked together at the
Mausoleum; such being the name of the tomb that was
erected by his wife Artemisia in honour of Mausolus, a petty
king of Caria, who died in the second year of the hundred and
seventh Olympiad. It was through the exertions of these
artists more particularly, that this work came to be reckoned
one of the Seven Wonders of the World.<a id="FNanchor_2426_2426"></a><a href="#Footnote_2426_2426" class="fnanchor">2426</a> The circumference<a id="FNanchor_2427_2427"></a><a href="#Footnote_2427_2427" class="fnanchor">2427</a>
of this building is, in all, four hundred and forty feet,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>and the breadth from north to south sixty-three, the two
fronts<a id="FNanchor_2428_2428"></a><a href="#Footnote_2428_2428" class="fnanchor">2428</a> being not so wide in extent. It is twenty-five cubits
in height, and is surrounded with six-and-thirty columns,
the outer circumference being known as the ‚ÄúPteron.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2429_2429"></a><a href="#Footnote_2429_2429" class="fnanchor">2429</a> The
east side was sculptured by Scopas, the north by Bryaxis, the
south by Timotheus, and the west by Leochares; but, before
their task was completed, Queen Artemisia died.<a id="FNanchor_2430_2430"></a><a href="#Footnote_2430_2430" class="fnanchor">2430</a> They did
not leave their work, however, until it was finished, considering
that it was at once a memorial of their own fame and of
the sculptor‚Äôs art: and, to this day even, it is undecided which
of them has excelled. A fifth artist also took part in the
work; for above the Pteron there is a pyramid erected, equal
in height to the building below, and formed of four and
twenty steps, which gradually taper upwards towards the
summit; a platform, crowned with a representation of a four-horse
chariot by Pythis. This addition makes the total height
of the work one hundred and forty feet.<a id="FNanchor_2431_2431"></a><a href="#Footnote_2431_2431" class="fnanchor">2431</a></p>

<p>There is at Rome, by Timotheus, a Diana, in the Temple of
Apollo in the Palatium, the head of which has been replaced
by Avianius Evander.<a id="FNanchor_2432_2432"></a><a href="#Footnote_2432_2432" class="fnanchor">2432</a> A Hercules, too, by Menestratus,<a id="FNanchor_2433_2433"></a><a href="#Footnote_2433_2433" class="fnanchor">2433</a> is
greatly admired; and there is a Hecate of his at Ephesus, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>the Temple of Diana there, behind the sanctuary. The keepers
of the temple recommend persons, when viewing it, to be
careful of their eyes, so remarkably radiant is the marble.
No less esteemed, too, are the statues of the Graces,<a id="FNanchor_2434_2434"></a><a href="#Footnote_2434_2434" class="fnanchor">2434</a> in the
Propyl√¶um<a id="FNanchor_2435_2435"></a><a href="#Footnote_2435_2435" class="fnanchor">2435</a> at Athens; the workmanship of Socrates the
sculptor, a different person from the painter<a id="FNanchor_2436_2436"></a><a href="#Footnote_2436_2436" class="fnanchor">2436</a> of that name,
though identical with him in the opinion of some. As to
Myron,<a id="FNanchor_2437_2437"></a><a href="#Footnote_2437_2437" class="fnanchor">2437</a> who is so highly praised for his works in bronze,
there is by him at Smyrna, An Old Woman Intoxicated, a
work that is held in high estimation.</p>

<p>Asinius Pollio, a man of a warm and ardent temperament,
was determined that the buildings which he erected as memorials
of himself should be made as attractive as possible; for
here we see groups representing, Nymphs carried off by Centaurs,
a work of Arcesilas:<a id="FNanchor_2438_2438"></a><a href="#Footnote_2438_2438" class="fnanchor">2438</a> the Thespiades,<a id="FNanchor_2439_2439"></a><a href="#Footnote_2439_2439" class="fnanchor">2439</a> by Cleomenes:<a id="FNanchor_2440_2440"></a><a href="#Footnote_2440_2440" class="fnanchor">2440</a> Oceanus
and Jupiter, by Heniochus:<a id="FNanchor_2441_2441"></a><a href="#Footnote_2441_2441" class="fnanchor">2441</a> the Appiades,<a id="FNanchor_2442_2442"></a><a href="#Footnote_2442_2442" class="fnanchor">2442</a> by Stephanus:<a id="FNanchor_2443_2443"></a><a href="#Footnote_2443_2443" class="fnanchor">2443</a>
Hermerotes,<a id="FNanchor_2444_2444"></a><a href="#Footnote_2444_2444" class="fnanchor">2444</a> by Tauriscus, not the chaser in silver, already<a id="FNanchor_2445_2445"></a><a href="#Footnote_2445_2445" class="fnanchor">2445</a>
mentioned, but a native of Tralles:<a id="FNanchor_2446_2446"></a><a href="#Footnote_2446_2446" class="fnanchor">2446</a> a Jupiter Hospitalis<a id="FNanchor_2447_2447"></a><a href="#Footnote_2447_2447" class="fnanchor">2447</a> by Papylus,
a pupil of Praxiteles: Zethus and Amphion, with Dirce,
the Bull,<a id="FNanchor_2448_2448"></a><a href="#Footnote_2448_2448" class="fnanchor">2448</a> and the halter, all sculptured from a single block of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>marble, the work of Apollonius and Tauriscus, and brought to
Rome from Rhodes. These two artists made it a sort of rivalry
as to their parentage, for they declared that, although Apollodorus
was their natural progenitor, Menecrates<a id="FNanchor_2449_2449"></a><a href="#Footnote_2449_2449" class="fnanchor">2449</a> would appear to have
been their father. In the same place, too, there is a Father
Liber,<a id="FNanchor_2450_2450"></a><a href="#Footnote_2450_2450" class="fnanchor">2450</a> by Eutychides,<a id="FNanchor_2451_2451"></a><a href="#Footnote_2451_2451" class="fnanchor">2451</a> highly praised. Near the Portico of Octavia,
there is an Apollo, by Philiscus<a id="FNanchor_2452_2452"></a><a href="#Footnote_2452_2452" class="fnanchor">2452</a> of Rhodes, placed in the
Temple of that God; a Latona and Diana also; the Nine Muses;
and another Apollo, without drapery. The Apollo holding the
Lyre, in the same temple, was executed by Timarchides.<a id="FNanchor_2453_2453"></a><a href="#Footnote_2453_2453" class="fnanchor">2453</a> In
the Temple of Juno, within the Porticos of Octavia, there is
a figure of that goddess, executed by Dionysius,<a id="FNanchor_2454_2454"></a><a href="#Footnote_2454_2454" class="fnanchor">2454</a> and another
by Polycles,<a id="FNanchor_2455_2455"></a><a href="#Footnote_2455_2455" class="fnanchor">2455</a> as also other statues by Praxiteles.<a id="FNanchor_2456_2456"></a><a href="#Footnote_2456_2456" class="fnanchor">2456</a> This Polycles,
too, in conjunction with Dionysius,<a id="FNanchor_2457_2457"></a><a href="#Footnote_2457_2457" class="fnanchor">2457</a> the son of Timarchides,
made the statue of Jupiter, which is to be seen in the
adjoining temple.<a id="FNanchor_2458_2458"></a><a href="#Footnote_2458_2458" class="fnanchor">2458</a> The figures of Pan and Olympus Wrestling,
in the same place, are by Heliodorus;<a id="FNanchor_2459_2459"></a><a href="#Footnote_2459_2459" class="fnanchor">2459</a> and they are considered
to be the next finest group<a id="FNanchor_2460_2460"></a><a href="#Footnote_2460_2460" class="fnanchor">2460</a> of this nature in all the world. The
same artist also executed a Venus at the Bath, and Polycharmus
another Venus, in an erect<a id="FNanchor_2461_2461"></a><a href="#Footnote_2461_2461" class="fnanchor">2461</a> posture.</p>

<p>By the honourable place which the work of Lysias occupies,
we may see in what high esteem it was held by the late Emperor
Augustus, who consecrated it in honour of his father
Octavius, in the Palatium, placing it on an arch within a small
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>temple, adorned with columns: it is the figure of a four-horse
chariot, with an Apollo and Diana, all sculptured from a single
block. I find it stated, also, that the Apollo by Calamis, the
chaser already<a id="FNanchor_2462_2462"></a><a href="#Footnote_2462_2462" class="fnanchor">2462</a> mentioned, the Pugilists by Dercylides, and
the statue of Callisthenes the historian, by Amphistratus,<a id="FNanchor_2463_2463"></a><a href="#Footnote_2463_2463" class="fnanchor">2463</a> all
of them now in the Gardens of Servilius, are works highly
esteemed.</p>

<p>Beyond these, there are not many sculptors of high repute;
for, in the case of several works of very great excellence,
the number of artists that have been engaged upon them has
proved a considerable obstacle to the fame of each, no individual
being able to engross the whole of the credit, and it being
impossible to award it in due proportion to the names of the
several artists combined. Such is the case with the Laoco√∂n,
for example, in the palace of the Emperor Titus, a work that
may be looked upon as preferable to any other production of
the art of painting or of statuary. It is sculptured from a single
block, both the main figure as well as the children, and the serpents
with their marvellous folds. This group was made in concert
by three most eminent artists,<a id="FNanchor_2464_2464"></a><a href="#Footnote_2464_2464" class="fnanchor">2464</a> Agesander, Polydorus, and
Athenodorus, natives of Rhodes. In similar manner also, the
palaces of the C√¶sars, in the Palatium, have been filled with
most splendid statuary, the work of Craterus, in conjunction
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>with Pythodorus, of Polydeuces with Hermol√§us, and of another
Pythodorus with Artemon; some of the statues, also, are by
Aphrodisius of Tralles, who worked alone. The Pantheon of
Agrippa has been decorated by Diogenes of Athens, and the
Caryatides, by him, which form the columns of that temple, are
looked upon as master-pieces of excellence: the same, too,
with the statues that are placed upon the roof, though, in
consequence of the height, they have not had an opportunity
of being so well appreciated.</p>

<p>Without glory, and excluded from every temple, is the
statue of Hercules,<a id="FNanchor_2465_2465"></a><a href="#Footnote_2465_2465" class="fnanchor">2465</a> in honour of whom the Carthaginians
were accustomed to sacrifice human victims every year: it
stands upon the ground before the entrance of the Portico of
the Nations.<a id="FNanchor_2466_2466"></a><a href="#Footnote_2466_2466" class="fnanchor">2466</a>  There were erected, too, near the Temple of
Felicity, the statues of the Thespian<a id="FNanchor_2467_2467"></a><a href="#Footnote_2467_2467" class="fnanchor">2467</a> Muses; of one of which,
according to Varro, Junius Pisciculus, a Roman of equestrian
rank, became enamoured. Pasiteles,<a id="FNanchor_2468_2468"></a><a href="#Footnote_2468_2468" class="fnanchor">2468</a> too, speaks in terms of
high admiration of them, the artist who wrote five Books on
the most celebrated works throughout the world. Born upon
the Grecian<a id="FNanchor_2469_2469"></a><a href="#Footnote_2469_2469" class="fnanchor">2469</a> shores of Italy, and presented with the Roman
citizenship granted to the cities of those parts, Pasiteles constructed
the ivory statue of Jupiter which is now in the Temple
of Metellus,<a id="FNanchor_2470_2470"></a><a href="#Footnote_2470_2470" class="fnanchor">2470</a> on the road to the Campus Martius. It so happened,
that being one day at the Docks,<a id="FNanchor_2471_2471"></a><a href="#Footnote_2471_2471" class="fnanchor">2471</a> where there were
some wild beasts from Africa, while he was viewing through
the bars of a cage a lion which he was engaged in drawing, a
panther made its escape from another cage, to the no small
danger of this most careful artist. He executed many other
works, it is said, but we do not find the names of them specifically
mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>Arcesila√ºs,<a id="FNanchor_2472_2472"></a><a href="#Footnote_2472_2472" class="fnanchor">2472</a> also, is an artist highly extolled by Varro; who
states that he had in his possession a Lioness in marble of his,
and Winged Cupids playing with it, some holding it with
cords, and others making it drink from a horn, the whole
sculptured from a single block: he says, also, that the fourteen
figures around the Theatre of Pompeius,<a id="FNanchor_2473_2473"></a><a href="#Footnote_2473_2473" class="fnanchor">2473</a> representing different
Nations, are the work of Coponius.</p>

<p>I find it stated that Canachus,<a id="FNanchor_2474_2474"></a><a href="#Footnote_2474_2474" class="fnanchor">2474</a> an artist highly praised among
the statuaries in bronze, executed some works also in marble.
Saurus,<a id="FNanchor_2475_2475"></a><a href="#Footnote_2475_2475" class="fnanchor">2475</a> too, and Batrachus must not be forgotten, Laced√¶monians
by birth, who built the temples<a id="FNanchor_2476_2476"></a><a href="#Footnote_2476_2476" class="fnanchor">2476</a> enclosed by the Porticos
of Octavia. Some are of opinion that these artists were
very wealthy men, and that they erected these buildings at
their own expense, expecting to be allowed to inscribe their
names thereon; but that, this indulgence being refused them,
they adopted another method of attaining their object. At
all events, there are still to be seen, at the present day, on the
spirals<a id="FNanchor_2477_2477"></a><a href="#Footnote_2477_2477" class="fnanchor">2477</a> of the columns, the figures of a lizard and a frog,<a id="FNanchor_2478_2478"></a><a href="#Footnote_2478_2478" class="fnanchor">2478</a>
emblematical of their names. In the Temple of Jupiter by
the same artists, the paintings, as well as all the other ornaments,
bear reference to the worship of a goddess. The<a id="FNanchor_2479_2479"></a><a href="#Footnote_2479_2479" class="fnanchor">2479</a> fact
is, that when the temple of Juno was completed, the porters, as
it is said, who were entrusted with the carriage of the statues,
made an exchange of them; and, on religious grounds, the
mistake was left uncorrected, from an impression that it had
been by the intervention of the divinities themselves, that
this seat of worship had been thus shared between them.
Hence it is that we see in the Temple of Juno, also, the ornaments
which properly pertain to the worship of Jupiter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>Some minute works in marble have also gained reputation for
their artists: by Myrmecides,<a id="FNanchor_2480_2480"></a><a href="#Footnote_2480_2480" class="fnanchor">2480</a> there was a four-horse chariot,
so small that it could be covered, driver and all, by the wings
of a fly; and by Callicrates,<a id="FNanchor_2481_2481"></a><a href="#Footnote_2481_2481" class="fnanchor">2481</a> some ants, in marble, the feet
and other limbs of which were so fine as to escape the sight.</p>

CHAP. 5. (6.)‚ÄîAT WHAT PERIOD MARBLE WAS FIRST USED IN
BUILDINGS.</span></h3></div>

<p>This must suffice for the sculptors in marble, and the works
that have gained the highest repute; with reference to which
subject it occurs to me to remark, that spotted marbles were not
then in fashion. In making their statues, these artists used the
marble of Thasos also,<a id="FNanchor_2482_2482"></a><a href="#Footnote_2482_2482" class="fnanchor">2482</a> one of the Cyclades, and of Lesbos, this
last being rather more livid than the other. The poet Menander,
in fact, who was a very careful enquirer into all matters of
luxury, is the first who has spoken, and that but rarely, of variegated
marbles, and, indeed, of the employment of marble in
general. Columns of this material were at first employed in
temples, not on grounds of superior elegance, (for that was not
thought of, as yet), but because no material could be found of
a more substantial nature. It was under these circumstances,
that the Temple<a id="FNanchor_2483_2483"></a><a href="#Footnote_2483_2483" class="fnanchor">2483</a> of the Olympian Jupiter was commenced at
Athens, the columns of which were brought by Sylla to Rome,
for the buildings in the Capitol.</p>

<p>Still, however, there had been a distinction drawn between
ordinary stone and marble, in the days of Homer even. The
poet speaks in one passage of a person<a id="FNanchor_2484_2484"></a><a href="#Footnote_2484_2484" class="fnanchor">2484</a> being struck down
with a huge mass of marble; but that is all; and when he
describes the abodes of royalty adorned with every elegance,
besides brass, gold, electrum,<a id="FNanchor_2485_2485"></a><a href="#Footnote_2485_2485" class="fnanchor">2485</a> and silver, he only mentions
ivory. Variegated marbles, in my opinion, were first discovered
in the quarries of Chios, when the inhabitants were
building the walls of their city; a circumstance which gave
rise to a facetious repartee on the part of M. Cicero. It being
the practice with them to show these walls to everybody, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>something magnificent; ‚ÄúI should admire them much more,‚Äù
said he, ‚Äúif you had built them of the stone used at Tibur.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2486_2486"></a><a href="#Footnote_2486_2486" class="fnanchor">2486</a>
And, by Hercules! the art of painting<a id="FNanchor_2487_2487"></a><a href="#Footnote_2487_2487" class="fnanchor">2487</a> never would have
been held in such esteem, or, indeed, in any esteem at all, if
variegated marbles had been held in admiration.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether the art of cutting marble into slabs,
is not an invention for which we are indebted to the people of
Caria. The most ancient instance of this practice, so far as I
know of, is found in the palace of Mausolus, at Halicarnassus,
the walls of which, in brick, are covered with marble of Proconnesus.
Mausolus died in the second year of the hundred
and seventh<a id="FNanchor_2488_2488"></a><a href="#Footnote_2488_2488" class="fnanchor">2488</a> Olympiad, being the year of Rome, 403.</p>

<p>The first person at Rome who covered the whole of the walls
of his house with marble, according to Cornelius Nepos,<a id="FNanchor_2489_2489"></a><a href="#Footnote_2489_2489" class="fnanchor">2489</a> was
Mamurra,<a id="FNanchor_2490_2490"></a><a href="#Footnote_2490_2490" class="fnanchor">2490</a> who dwelt upon the C√¶lian Hill, a member of the
equestrian order, and a native of Formi√¶, who had been pr√¶fect
of the engineers under C. C√¶sar in Gaul. Such was the
individual, that nothing may be wanting to the indignity
of the example, who first adopted this practice; the same
Mamurra, in fact, who has been so torn to pieces in the verses
of Catullus of Verona. Indeed, his own house proclaimed
more loudly than Catullus could proclaim it, that he had come
into possession of all that Gallia Comata had had to possess.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>For Nepos adds, as well, that he was the first to have all the
columns of his house made of nothing but solid marble, and
that, too, marble of Carystus<a id="FNanchor_2491_2491"></a><a href="#Footnote_2491_2491" class="fnanchor">2491</a> or of Luna.<a id="FNanchor_2492_2492"></a><a href="#Footnote_2492_2492" class="fnanchor">2492</a></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_8"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 8.‚ÄîAT WHAT PERIOD THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MARBLE CAME
INTO USE AT ROME.</span></h3></div>

<p>M. Lepidus, who was consul with Q. Catulus, was the
first to have the lintels of his house made of Numidian marble,
a thing for which he was greatly censured: he was consul in
the year of Rome, 676. This is the earliest instance that I
can find of the introduction of Numidian marble; not in the
form of pillars, however, or of slabs, as was the case with the
marble of Carystus, above-mentioned, but in blocks, and that
too, for the comparatively ignoble purpose of making the
thresholds of doors. Four-years after this Lepidus, L. Lucullus
was consul; the same person who gave its name, it is
very evident, to the Lucullan marble; for, taking a great fancy
to it, he introduced it at Rome. While other kinds of marble
are valued for their spots or their colours, this marble is entirely
black.<a id="FNanchor_2493_2493"></a><a href="#Footnote_2493_2493" class="fnanchor">2493</a> It is found in the island of Melos,<a id="FNanchor_2494_2494"></a><a href="#Footnote_2494_2494" class="fnanchor">2494</a> and is
pretty nearly the only marble that has taken its name from
the person who first introduced it. Among these personages,
Scaurus, in my opinion, was the first to build a theatre with
walls of marble: but whether they were only coated with
slabs of marble or were made of solid blocks highly polished,
such as we now see in the Temple of Jupiter Tonans,<a id="FNanchor_2495_2495"></a><a href="#Footnote_2495_2495" class="fnanchor">2495</a> in the
Capitol, I cannot exactly say: for, up to this period, I cannot
find any vestiges of the use of marble slabs in Italy.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_9"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 9.‚ÄîTHE METHOD OF CUTTING MARBLE INTO SLABS. THE
SAND USED IN CUTTING MARBLE.</span></h3></div>

<p>But whoever it was that first invented the art of thus cutting
marble, and so multiplying the appliances of luxury, he displayed
considerable ingenuity, though to little purpose. This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>division, though apparently effected by the aid of iron, is in
reality effected by sand; the saw acting only by pressing upon
the sand within a very fine cleft in the stone, as it is moved
to and fro.</p>

<p>The<a id="FNanchor_2496_2496"></a><a href="#Footnote_2496_2496" class="fnanchor">2496</a> sand of √Üthiopia is the most highly esteemed for this
purpose; for, to add to the trouble that is entailed, we have
to send to √Üthiopia for the purpose of preparing our marble‚Äîaye,
and as far as India even; whereas in former times, the
severity of the Roman manners thought it beneath them to
repair thither in search of such costly things even as pearls!
This Indian sand is held in the next highest degree of estimation,
the √Üthiopian being of a softer nature, and better
adapted for dividing the stone without leaving any roughness
on the surface; whereas the sand from India does not leave so
smooth a face upon it. Still, however, for polishing marble,
we find it recommended<a id="FNanchor_2497_2497"></a><a href="#Footnote_2497_2497" class="fnanchor">2497</a> to rub it with Indian sand calcined.
The sand of Naxos has the same defect; as also that from
Coptos, generally known as ‚ÄúEgyptian‚Äù sand.</p>

<p>The above were the several varieties of sand used by the
ancients in dividing marble. More recently, a sand has been
discovered that is equally approved of for this purpose; in a
certain creek of the Adriatic Sea, which is left dry at low
water only; a thing that renders it not very easy to be found.
At the present day, however, the fraudulent tendencies of our
workers in marble have emboldened them to use any kind of
river-sand for the purpose; a mischief which very few employers
rightly appreciate. For, the coarser the sand, the
wider is the division made in the stone, the greater the quantity
of material consumed, and the more extensive the labour
required for polishing the rough surface that is left; a result
of which is that the slabs lose so much more in thickness.
For giving the last polish to marble,<a id="FNanchor_2498_2498"></a><a href="#Footnote_2498_2498" class="fnanchor">2498</a> Thebaic stone<a id="FNanchor_2499_2499"></a><a href="#Footnote_2499_2499" class="fnanchor">2499</a> is considered
well adapted, as also porous stone, or pumice, powdered
fine.</p>

<p>For polishing marble statues, as also for cutting and giving
a polish to precious stones, the preference was long given to
the stone of Naxos,<a id="FNanchor_2500_2500"></a><a href="#Footnote_2500_2500" class="fnanchor">2500</a> such being the name of a kind of touchstone<a id="FNanchor_2501_2501"></a><a href="#Footnote_2501_2501" class="fnanchor">2501</a>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_11"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 11.‚ÄîTHE MARBLES OF ALEXANDRIA.</span></h3></div>

<p>The marbles are too well known to make it necessary for
me to enumerate their several colours and varieties; and,
indeed, so numerous are they, that it would be no easy task to
do so. For what place is there, in fact, that has not a marble
of its own? In addition to which, in our description of the
earth and its various peoples,<a id="FNanchor_2502_2502"></a><a href="#Footnote_2502_2502" class="fnanchor">2502</a> we have already made it our
care to mention the more celebrated kinds of marble. Still,
however, they are not all of them produced from quarries, but
in many instances lie scattered just beneath the surface of the
earth; some of them the most precious even, the green Laced√¶monian
marble, for example, more brilliant in colour than
any other; the Augustan also; and, more recently, the Tiberian;
which were first discovered, in the reigns respectively of
Augustus and Tiberius, in Egypt. These two marbles differ
from ophites<a id="FNanchor_2503_2503"></a><a href="#Footnote_2503_2503" class="fnanchor">2503</a> in the circumstance that the latter is marked
with streaks which resemble serpents<a id="FNanchor_2504_2504"></a><a href="#Footnote_2504_2504" class="fnanchor">2504</a> in appearance, whence
its name. There is also this difference between the two
marbles themselves, in the arrangement of their spots: the
Augustan marble has them undulated and curling to a point;
whereas in the Tiberian the streaks are white,<a id="FNanchor_2505_2505"></a><a href="#Footnote_2505_2505" class="fnanchor">2505</a> not involved,
but lying wide asunder.</p>

<p>Of ophites, there are only some very small pillars known to
have been made. There are two varieties of it, one white
and soft, the other inclining to black, and hard. Both kinds,
it is said, worn as an amulet, are a cure for head-ache, and for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>wounds inflicted by serpents.<a id="FNanchor_2506_2506"></a><a href="#Footnote_2506_2506" class="fnanchor">2506</a> Some, too, recommend the
white ophites as an amulet for phrenitis and lethargy. As a
counter-poison to serpents, some persons speak more particularly
in praise of the ophites that is known as ‚Äútephrias,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2507_2507"></a><a href="#Footnote_2507_2507" class="fnanchor">2507</a>
from its ashy colour. There is also a marble known as
‚Äúmemphites,‚Äù from the place<a id="FNanchor_2508_2508"></a><a href="#Footnote_2508_2508" class="fnanchor">2508</a> where it is found, and of a
nature somewhat analogous to the precious stones. For medicinal
purposes, it is triturated and applied in the form of a
liniment, with vinegar, to such parts of the body as require
cauterizing or incision; the flesh becoming quite benumbed,
and thereby rendered insensible to pain.</p>

<p>Porphyrites,<a id="FNanchor_2509_2509"></a><a href="#Footnote_2509_2509" class="fnanchor">2509</a> which is another production of Egypt, is of a
red colour: the kind that is mottled with white blotches is
known as ‚Äúleptospsephos.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2510_2510"></a><a href="#Footnote_2510_2510" class="fnanchor">2510</a> The quarries there are able to
furnish blocks<a id="FNanchor_2511_2511"></a><a href="#Footnote_2511_2511" class="fnanchor">2511</a> of any dimensions, however large. Vitrasius
Pollio, who was steward<a id="FNanchor_2512_2512"></a><a href="#Footnote_2512_2512" class="fnanchor">2512</a> in Egypt for the Emperor Claudius,
brought to Rome from Egypt some statues made of this stone;
a novelty which was not very highly approved of, as no one
has since followed his example. The Egyptians, too, have
discovered in √Üthiopia the stone known as ‚Äúbasanites;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2513_2513"></a><a href="#Footnote_2513_2513" class="fnanchor">2513</a>
which in colour and hardness resembles iron, whence the
name<a id="FNanchor_2514_2514"></a><a href="#Footnote_2514_2514" class="fnanchor">2514</a> that has been given to it. A larger block of it has
never been known than the one forming the group which has
been dedicated by the Emperor Vespasianus Augustus in the
Temple of Peace. It represents the river Nilus with sixteen
children sporting around it,<a id="FNanchor_2515_2515"></a><a href="#Footnote_2515_2515" class="fnanchor">2515</a> symbolical of the sixteen cubits,
the extreme height<a id="FNanchor_2516_2516"></a><a href="#Footnote_2516_2516" class="fnanchor">2516</a> to which, in the most favourable seasons,
that river should rise. It is stated, too, that in the Temple
of Serapis at Thebes, there is a block not unlike it, which
forms the statue of Memnon<a id="FNanchor_2517_2517"></a><a href="#Footnote_2517_2517" class="fnanchor">2517</a> there; remarkable, it is said, for

Drinking-vessels were made of it at first, and then the feet of
beds and chairs. Cornelius Nepos relates that great was the
astonishment, when P. Lentulus Spinther exhibited amphor√¶
made of this material, as large as Chian wine-vessels in
size; ‚Äúand yet, five years after,‚Äù says he, ‚ÄúI saw columns of
this material, no less than two-and-thirty feet in height.‚Äù At
a more recent period again, some change took place<a id="FNanchor_2521_2521"></a><a href="#Footnote_2521_2521" class="fnanchor">2521</a> with
reference to this stone; for four<a id="FNanchor_2522_2522"></a><a href="#Footnote_2522_2522" class="fnanchor">2522</a> small pillars of it were
erected by Cornelius Balbus in his Theatre<a id="FNanchor_2523_2523"></a><a href="#Footnote_2523_2523" class="fnanchor">2523</a> as something
quite marvellous: and I myself have seen thirty columns, of
larger size, in the banquetting-room which Callistus<a id="FNanchor_2524_2524"></a><a href="#Footnote_2524_2524" class="fnanchor">2524</a> erected,
the freedman of Claudius, so well known for the influence
which he possessed.</p>

<p>(8.) This<a id="FNanchor_2525_2525"></a><a href="#Footnote_2525_2525" class="fnanchor">2525</a> stone is called ‚Äúalabastrites‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2526_2526"></a><a href="#Footnote_2526_2526" class="fnanchor">2526</a> by some, and is
hollowed out into vessels for holding unguents, it having the

others. The most esteemed kind, however, is that of Carmania,
the next being the produce of India, and then, those of
Syria and Asia. The worst in quality is that of Cappadocia,
it being utterly destitute of lustre. That which is of a honey
colour is the most esteemed, covered with spots curling in
whirls,<a id="FNanchor_2529_2529"></a><a href="#Footnote_2529_2529" class="fnanchor">2529</a> and not transparent. Alabastrites is considered defective,

imported from Arabia, being remarkable for its extreme
whiteness.</p>

<p>Great value is placed also upon two other kinds of stone, of
quite a contrary nature; corallitic<a id="FNanchor_2531_2531"></a><a href="#Footnote_2531_2531" class="fnanchor">2531</a> stone, found in Asia, in blocks
not more than two cubits in thickness, and of a white somewhat
approaching that of ivory, and in some degree resembling
it; and Alabandic stone, which, on the other hand, is black,
and is so called from the district<a id="FNanchor_2532_2532"></a><a href="#Footnote_2532_2532" class="fnanchor">2532</a> which produces it: though
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>it is also to be found at Miletus, where, however, it verges
somewhat more upon the purple. It admits of being melted
by the action of fire, and is fused for the preparation of glass.</p>

<p>Thebaic stone, which is sprinkled all over with spots like
gold, is found in Africa, on the side of it which lies adjacent
to Egypt; the small hones which it supplies being peculiarly
adapted, from their natural properties, for grinding the ingredients
used in preparations for the eyes. In the neighbourhood
of Syene, too, in Thebais, there is a stone found
that is now known as ‚Äúsyenites,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2533_2533"></a><a href="#Footnote_2533_2533" class="fnanchor">2533</a> but was formerly called

engraved thereon are no other than Egyptian letters.<a id="FNanchor_2539_2539"></a><a href="#Footnote_2539_2539" class="fnanchor">2539</a></p>

<p>At a later period other kings had these obelisks hewn.
Sesosthes<a id="FNanchor_2540_2540"></a><a href="#Footnote_2540_2540" class="fnanchor">2540</a> erected four of them in the above-named city,
forty-eight cubits in height. Rhamsesis,<a id="FNanchor_2541_2541"></a><a href="#Footnote_2541_2541" class="fnanchor">2541</a> too, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>reigning at the time of the capture of Troy, erected one, a
hundred and forty cubits high. Having quitted the spot
where the palace of Mnevis<a id="FNanchor_2542_2542"></a><a href="#Footnote_2542_2542" class="fnanchor">2542</a> stood, this monarch erected
another obelisk,<a id="FNanchor_2543_2543"></a><a href="#Footnote_2543_2543" class="fnanchor">2543</a> one hundred and twenty cubits in height,
but of prodigious thickness, the sides being no less than
eleven cubits in breadth. (9.) It is said that one hundred
and twenty thousand men were employed upon this work;<a href="#Footnote_2543_2543" class="fnanchor">2543</a>
and that the king, when it was on the point of being elevated,
being apprehensive that the machinery employed might not
prove strong enough for the weight, with the view of increasing
the peril that might be entailed by due want of precaution
on the part of the workmen, had his own son fastened to the
summit; in order that the safety of the prince might at the
same time ensure the safety of the mass of stone. It was in his
admiration of this work, that, when King Cambyses took the
city by storm, and the conflagration had already reached the
very foot of the obelisk, he ordered the fire to be extinguished;
he entertaining a respect for this stupendous erection which
he had not entertained for the city itself.</p>

<p>There are also two other obelisks, one of them erected by
Zmarres,<a id="FNanchor_2544_2544"></a><a href="#Footnote_2544_2544" class="fnanchor">2544</a> and the other by Phius;<a id="FNanchor_2545_2545"></a><a href="#Footnote_2545_2545" class="fnanchor">2545</a> both of them without
inscriptions, and forty-eight cubits in height. Ptolem√¶us
Philadelphus had one erected at Alexandria, eighty cubits
high, which had been prepared by order of King Necthebis:<a id="FNanchor_2546_2546"></a><a href="#Footnote_2546_2546" class="fnanchor">2546</a>
it was without any inscription, and cost far more trouble in
its carriage and elevation, than had been originally expended
in quarrying it. Some writers inform us that it was conveyed
on a raft, under the inspection of the architect Satyrus;
but Callixenus<a id="FNanchor_2547_2547"></a><a href="#Footnote_2547_2547" class="fnanchor">2547</a> gives the name of Ph≈ìnix. For this purpose,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>a canal was dug from the river Nilus to the spot where
the obelisk lay; and two broad vessels, laden with blocks of
similar stone a foot square, the cargo of each amounting to
double the size, and consequently double the weight, of the
obelisk, were brought beneath it; the extremities, of the
obelisk remaining supported by the opposite sides of the canal.
The blocks of stone were then removed, and the vessels, being
thus gradually lightened, received their burden. It was
erected upon a basis of six square blocks, quarried from the
same mountain, and the artist was rewarded with the sum of
fifty talents.<a id="FNanchor_2548_2548"></a><a href="#Footnote_2548_2548" class="fnanchor">2548</a> This obelisk was placed by the king above-mentioned
in the Arsino≈ìum,<a id="FNanchor_2549_2549"></a><a href="#Footnote_2549_2549" class="fnanchor">2549</a> in testimony of his affection for
his wife and sister Arsino√´. At a later period, as it was found
to be an inconvenience to the docks, Maximus, the then pr√¶fect
of Egypt, had it transferred to the Forum there, after removing
the summit for the purpose of substituting a gilded point; an
intention which was ultimately abandoned.</p>

<p>There are two other obelisks, which were in C√¶sar‚Äôs Temple
at Alexandria, near the harbour there, forty-two cubits in
height, and originally hewn by order of King Mesphres. But
the most difficult enterprise of all, was the carriage of these
obelisks by sea to Rome, in vessels which excited the greatest
admiration. Indeed, the late Emperor Augustus consecrated
the one which brought over the first obelisk, as a lasting
memorial of this marvellous undertaking, in the docks at
Puteoli; but it was destroyed by fire. As to the one in which,
by order of the Emperor Caius,<a id="FNanchor_2550_2550"></a><a href="#Footnote_2550_2550" class="fnanchor">2550</a> the other obelisk had been
transported to Rome, after having been preserved for some
years and looked upon as the most wonderful construction ever
beheld upon the seas, it was brought to Ostia, by order of the
late Emperor Claudius; and towers of Puteolan<a id="FNanchor_2551_2551"></a><a href="#Footnote_2551_2551" class="fnanchor">2551</a> earth being
first erected upon it, it was sunk for the construction of the
harbour which he was making there. And then, besides, there
was the necessity of constructing other vessels to carry these
obelisks up the Tiber; by which it became practically ascertained,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>that the depth of water in that river is not less than
that of the river Nilus.</p>

<p>The obelisk that was erected by the late Emperor Augustus
in the Great Circus,<a id="FNanchor_2552_2552"></a><a href="#Footnote_2552_2552" class="fnanchor">2552</a> was originally quarried by order of King
Semenpserteus,<a id="FNanchor_2553_2553"></a><a href="#Footnote_2553_2553" class="fnanchor">2553</a> in whose reign it was that Pythagoras<a id="FNanchor_2554_2554"></a><a href="#Footnote_2554_2554" class="fnanchor">2554</a> visited
Egypt. It is eighty-five feet<a id="FNanchor_2555_2555"></a><a href="#Footnote_2555_2555" class="fnanchor">2555</a> and three quarters in height,
exclusive of the base, which is a part of the same stone. The
one that he erected in the Campus Martius, is nine feet less in
height, and was originally made by order of Sesothis. They
are both of them covered with inscriptions, which interpret
the operations of Nature according to the philosophy of the
Egyptians.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_15"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 15. (10.)‚ÄîTHE OBELISK WHICH SERVES AS A DIAL IN THE
CAMPUS MARTIUS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The one that has been erected in the Campus Martius<a id="FNanchor_2556_2556"></a><a href="#Footnote_2556_2556" class="fnanchor">2556</a> has
been applied to a singular purpose by the late Emperor
Augustus; that of marking the shadows projected by the sun,
and so measuring the length of the days and nights. With this
object, a stone pavement was laid, the extreme length of
which corresponded exactly with the length of the shadow
thrown by the obelisk at the sixth hour<a id="FNanchor_2557_2557"></a><a href="#Footnote_2557_2557" class="fnanchor">2557</a> on the day of the winter
solstice. After this period, the shadow would go on, day by
day, gradually decreasing, and then again<a id="FNanchor_2558_2558"></a><a href="#Footnote_2558_2558" class="fnanchor">2558</a> would as gradually
increase, correspondingly with certain lines of brass that were
inserted in the stone; a device well deserving to be known,
and due to the ingenuity of Facundus Novus, the mathematician.
Upon the apex of the obelisk he placed a gilded
ball, in order that the shadow of the summit might be condensed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>and agglomerated, and so prevent the shadow of the
apex itself from running to a fine point of enormous extent;
the plan being first suggested to him, it is said, by the shadow
that is projected by the human head. For nearly the last
thirty years, however, the observations derived from this dial
have been found not to agree: whether it is that the sun
itself has changed its course in consequence of some derangement
of the heavenly system; or whether that the whole
earth has been in some degree displaced from its centre, a
thing that, I have heard say, has been remarked in other places
as well; or whether that some earthquake, confined to this
city only, has wrenched the dial from its original position; or
whether it is that in consequence of the inundations of the
Tiber, the foundations of the mass have subsided, in spite of
the general assertion that they are sunk as deep into the earth
as the obelisk erected upon them is high.</p>

<p>(11.) The third<a id="FNanchor_2559_2559"></a><a href="#Footnote_2559_2559" class="fnanchor">2559</a> obelisk<a id="FNanchor_2560_2560"></a><a href="#Footnote_2560_2560" class="fnanchor">2560</a> at Rome is in the Vaticanian<a id="FNanchor_2561_2561"></a><a href="#Footnote_2561_2561" class="fnanchor">2561</a>
Circus, which was constructed by the Emperors Caius<a id="FNanchor_2562_2562"></a><a href="#Footnote_2562_2562" class="fnanchor">2562</a> and Nero;
this being the only one of them all that has been broken in
the carriage. Nuncoreus,<a id="FNanchor_2563_2563"></a><a href="#Footnote_2563_2563" class="fnanchor">2563</a> the son of Sesoses, made it: and
there remains<a id="FNanchor_2564_2564"></a><a href="#Footnote_2564_2564" class="fnanchor">2564</a> another by him, one hundred cubits in height,
which, by order of an oracle, he consecrated to the Sun, after
having lost his sight and recovered it.</p>

CHAP. 16. (12.)‚ÄîMARVELLOUS WORKS IN EGYPT. THE PYRAMIDS.</span></h3></div>

<p>We must make some mention, too, however cursorily, of the
Pyramids of Egypt, so many idle<a id="FNanchor_2565_2565"></a><a href="#Footnote_2565_2565" class="fnanchor">2565</a> and frivolous pieces of
ostentation of their resources, on the part of the monarchs of
that country. Indeed, it is asserted by most persons, that the
only motive for constructing them, was either a determination
not to leave their treasures to their successors or to rivals that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>might be plotting to supplant them, or to prevent the lower
classes from remaining unoccupied. There was great vanity
displayed by these men in constructions of this description,
and there are still the remains of many of them in an unfinished
state. There is one to be seen in the Nome of Arsino√Øtes;<a id="FNanchor_2566_2566"></a><a href="#Footnote_2566_2566" class="fnanchor">2566</a>
two in that of Memphites, not far from the Labyrinth,
of which we shall shortly have to speak;<a id="FNanchor_2567_2567"></a><a href="#Footnote_2567_2567" class="fnanchor">2567</a> and two in the place
where Lake M≈ìris<a id="FNanchor_2568_2568"></a><a href="#Footnote_2568_2568" class="fnanchor">2568</a> was excavated, an immense artificial
piece of water, cited by the Egyptians among their wondrous
and memorable works: the summits of the pyramids, it is said,
are to be seen above the water.</p>

<p>The other three pyramids, the renown of which has filled
the whole earth, and which are conspicuous from every quarter
to persons navigating the river, are situate on the African<a id="FNanchor_2569_2569"></a><a href="#Footnote_2569_2569" class="fnanchor">2569</a>
side of it, upon a rocky sterile elevation. They lie between
the city of Memphis and what we have mentioned<a id="FNanchor_2570_2570"></a><a href="#Footnote_2570_2570" class="fnanchor">2570</a> as the
Delta, within four miles of the river, and seven miles and
a-half from Memphis, near a village known as Busiris, the
people of which are in the habit of ascending them.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_17"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 17.‚ÄîTHE EGYPTIAN SPHINX.</span></h3></div>

<p>In front of these pyramids is the Sphinx,<a id="FNanchor_2571_2571"></a><a href="#Footnote_2571_2571" class="fnanchor">2571</a> a still more
wondrous object of art, but one upon which silence has been
observed, as it is looked upon as a divinity by the people of
the neighbourhood. It is their belief that King Harma√Øs was
buried in it, and they will have it that it was brought there
from a distance. The truth is, however, that it was hewn
from the solid rock; and, from a feeling of veneration, the face
of the monster is coloured red. The circumference of the head,
measured round the forehead, is one hundred and two feet, the
length of the feet being one hundred and forty-three, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>height, from the belly to the summit of the asp on the head,
sixty-two.<a id="FNanchor_2572_2572"></a><a href="#Footnote_2572_2572" class="fnanchor">2572</a></p>

<p>The largest<a id="FNanchor_2573_2573"></a><a href="#Footnote_2573_2573" class="fnanchor">2573</a> Pyramid is built of stone quarried in Arabia:
three hundred and sixty thousand men, it is said, were employed
upon it twenty years, and the three were completed in
seventy-eight years and four months. They are described by
the following writers: Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_2574_2574"></a><a href="#Footnote_2574_2574" class="fnanchor">2574</a> Euhemerus, Duris of
Samos, Aristagoras, Dionysius, Artemidorus, Alexander Polyhistor,
Butoridas, Antisthenes, Demetrius, Demoteles, and
Apion. These authors, however, are disagreed as to the persons
by whom they were constructed; accident having, with very
considerable justice, consigned to oblivion the names of those
who erected such stupendous memorials of their vanity. Some
of these writers inform us that fifteen hundred talents were
expended upon radishes, garlic, and onions<a id="FNanchor_2575_2575"></a><a href="#Footnote_2575_2575" class="fnanchor">2575</a> alone.</p>

<p>The largest Pyramid occupies seven<a id="FNanchor_2576_2576"></a><a href="#Footnote_2576_2576" class="fnanchor">2576</a> jugera of ground, and
the four angles are equidistant, the face of each side being eight
hundred and thirty-three<a id="FNanchor_2577_2577"></a><a href="#Footnote_2577_2577" class="fnanchor">2577</a> feet in length. The total height
from the ground to the summit is seven hundred and twenty-five
feet, and the platform on the summit is sixteen feet and
a-half in circuit. Of the second Pyramid, the faces of the four
sides are each seven hundred and fifty-seven feet and a-half in
length.<a id="FNanchor_2578_2578"></a><a href="#Footnote_2578_2578" class="fnanchor">2578</a> The third is smaller than the others, but far more
prepossessing in appearance: it is built of  √Üthiopian stone,<a id="FNanchor_2579_2579"></a><a href="#Footnote_2579_2579" class="fnanchor">2579</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>and the face between the four corners is three hundred and
sixty-three feet in extent. In the vicinity of these erections,
there are no vestiges of any buildings left. Far and wide
there is nothing but sand to be seen, of a grain somewhat like
a lentil in appearance, similar to that of the greater part of
Africa, in fact.</p>

<p>The most difficult problem is, to know how the materials
for construction could possibly be carried to so vast a height.
According to some authorities, as the building gradually advanced,
they heaped up against it vast mounds of nitre<a id="FNanchor_2580_2580"></a><a href="#Footnote_2580_2580" class="fnanchor">2580</a> and
salt; which piles were melted after its completion, by introducing
beneath them the waters of the river. Others, again,
maintain, that bridges were constructed, of bricks of clay, and
that, when the pyramid was completed, these bricks were distributed
for erecting the houses of private individuals. For<a id="FNanchor_2581_2581"></a><a href="#Footnote_2581_2581" class="fnanchor">2581</a>
the level of the river, they say, being so much lower, water
could never by any possibility have been brought there by the
medium of canals. In the interior of the largest Pyramid
there is a well, eighty-six cubits deep, which communicates
with the river, it is thought. The method of ascertaining the
height of the Pyramids and all similar edifices was discovered<a id="FNanchor_2582_2582"></a><a href="#Footnote_2582_2582" class="fnanchor">2582</a>
by Thales of Miletus; he measuring the shadow at the hour of
the day at which it is equal in length to the body projecting it.</p>

<p>Such are the marvellous Pyramids; but the crowning marvel
of all is, that the smallest, but most admired of them‚Äîthat we
may feel no surprise at the opulence of the kings‚Äîwas built by
Rhodopis,<a id="FNanchor_2583_2583"></a><a href="#Footnote_2583_2583" class="fnanchor">2583</a> a courtesan! This woman was once the fellow-slave
of √Üsopus the philosopher and fabulist, and the sharer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>of his bed; but what is much more surprising is, that a courtesan
should have been enabled, by her vocation, to amass such
enormous wealth.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_18"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 18.‚ÄîTHE PHAROS.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is another building, too, that is highly celebrated;
the tower that was built by a king of Egypt, on the island of
Pharos, at the entrance to the<a id="FNanchor_2584_2584"></a><a href="#Footnote_2584_2584" class="fnanchor">2584</a> harbour of Alexandria. The
cost of its erection was eight hundred talents, they say; and,
not to omit the magnanimity that was shown by King Ptolem√¶us<a id="FNanchor_2585_2585"></a><a href="#Footnote_2585_2585" class="fnanchor">2585</a>
on this occasion, he gave permission to the architect,
Sostratus<a id="FNanchor_2586_2586"></a><a href="#Footnote_2586_2586" class="fnanchor">2586</a> of Cnidos, to inscribe his name upon the edifice
itself. The object of it is, by the light of its fires at night,
to give warning to ships, of the neighbouring shoals, and to
point out to them the entrance of the harbour. At the
present day, there are similar fires lighted up in numerous
places, Ostia and Ravenna, for example. The only danger<a id="FNanchor_2587_2587"></a><a href="#Footnote_2587_2587" class="fnanchor">2587</a>
is, that when these fires are thus kept burning without intermission,
they may be mistaken for stars, the flames having
very much that appearance at a distance. This architect is
the first person that built a promenade upon arches; at Cnidos,
it is said.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_19"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 19. (13.)‚ÄîLABYRINTHS.</span></h3></div>

<p>We must speak also of the Labyrinths, the most stupendous
works, perhaps, on which mankind has expended its labours;
and not for chimerical purposes, merely, as might possibly be
supposed.</p>

<p>There is still in Egypt, in the Nome of Heracleopolites,<a id="FNanchor_2588_2588"></a><a href="#Footnote_2588_2588" class="fnanchor">2588</a> a
labyrinth,<a id="FNanchor_2589_2589"></a><a href="#Footnote_2589_2589" class="fnanchor">2589</a> which was the first constructed, three thousand
six hundred years ago, they say, by King Petesuchis or
Tith√∂es: although, according to Herodotus, the entire work
was the production of no less than twelve kings, the last of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>whom was Psammetichus. As to the purpose for which it
was built, there are various opinions: Demoteles says that it
was the palace of King Moteris, and Lyceas that it was the tomb
of M≈ìris, while many others assert that it was a building
consecrated to the Sun, an opinion which mostly prevails.</p>

<p>That D√¶dalus took this for the model of the Labyrinth
which he constructed in Crete, there can be no doubt; though
he only reproduced the hundredth part of it, that portion,
namely, which encloses circuitous passages, windings, and
inextricable galleries which lead to and fro. We must not,
comparing this last to what we see delineated on our mosaic
pavements, or to the mazes<a id="FNanchor_2590_2590"></a><a href="#Footnote_2590_2590" class="fnanchor">2590</a> formed in the fields for the
amusement of children, suppose it to be a narrow promenade
along which we may walk for many miles together; but we
must picture to ourselves a building filled with numerous
doors, and galleries which continually mislead the visitor,
bringing him back, after all his wanderings, to the spot from
which he first set out. This<a id="FNanchor_2591_2591"></a><a href="#Footnote_2591_2591" class="fnanchor">2591</a> Labyrinth is the second, that of
Egypt being the first. There is a third in the Isle of
Lemnos, and a fourth in Italy.</p>

<p>They are all of them covered with arched roofs of polished
stone; at the entrance, too, of the Egyptian Labyrinth, a thing
that surprises me, the building is constructed of Parian marble,
while throughout the other parts of it the columns are of
syenites.<a id="FNanchor_2592_2592"></a><a href="#Footnote_2592_2592" class="fnanchor">2592</a> With such solidity is this huge mass constructed,
that the lapse of ages has been totally unable to destroy it,
seconded as it has been by the people of Heracleopolites, who
have marvellously ravaged a work which they have always
held in abhorrence. To detail the position of this work and
the various portions of it is quite impossible, it being subdivided
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>into regions and pr√¶fectures, which are styled nomes,<a id="FNanchor_2593_2593"></a><a href="#Footnote_2593_2593" class="fnanchor">2593</a>
thirty in number, with a vast palace assigned to each. In
addition to these, it should contain temples of all the gods of
Egypt, and forty statues of Nemesis<a id="FNanchor_2594_2594"></a><a href="#Footnote_2594_2594" class="fnanchor">2594</a> in as many sacred
shrines; besides numerous pyramids, forty ells<a id="FNanchor_2595_2595"></a><a href="#Footnote_2595_2595" class="fnanchor">2595</a> in height, and
covering six arur√¶<a id="FNanchor_2596_2596"></a><a href="#Footnote_2596_2596" class="fnanchor">2596</a> at the base. Fatigued with wandering
to and fro, the visitor is sure to arrive at some inextricable
crossing or other of the galleries. And then, too, there are
banquetting rooms situate at the summit of steep ascents;
porticos from which we descend by flights of ninety steps;
columns in the interior, made of porphyrites;<a id="FNanchor_2597_2597"></a><a href="#Footnote_2597_2597" class="fnanchor">2597</a> figures of gods;
statues of kings; and effigies of hideous monsters. Some of
the palaces are so peculiarly constructed, that the moment the
doors are opened a dreadful sound like that of thunder reverberates
within: the greater part, too, of these edifices have to be
traversed in total darkness. Then again, without the walls of
the Labyrinth, there rises another mass of buildings known as
the ‚ÄúPteron;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2598_2598"></a><a href="#Footnote_2598_2598" class="fnanchor">2598</a> beneath which there are passages excavated
leading to other subterranean palaces. One person, and only
one, has made some slight repairs to the Labyrinth; Ch√¶remon,<a id="FNanchor_2599_2599"></a><a href="#Footnote_2599_2599" class="fnanchor">2599</a>
an eunuch of King Necthebis, who lived five hundred
years before the time of Alexander the Great. It is asserted,
also, that while the arched roofs of squared stone were being
raised, he had them supported by beams of thorn<a id="FNanchor_2600_2600"></a><a href="#Footnote_2600_2600" class="fnanchor">2600</a> boiled
in oil.</p>

<p>As for the Cretan Labyrinth, what I have already stated
must suffice for that. The Labyrinth of Lemnos<a id="FNanchor_2601_2601"></a><a href="#Footnote_2601_2601" class="fnanchor">2601</a> is similar
to it, only that it is rendered more imposing by its
hundred and fifty columns; the shafts of which, when in the
stone-yard, were so nicely balanced, that a child was able to
manage the wheel of the lathe in turning them. The architects
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>were, Smilis,<a id="FNanchor_2602_2602"></a><a href="#Footnote_2602_2602" class="fnanchor">2602</a> Rh≈ìcus,<a id="FNanchor_2603_2603"></a><a href="#Footnote_2603_2603" class="fnanchor">2603</a> and Theodorus, natives of the
island, and there are still in existence some remains of it;
whereas of the Cretan Labyrinth and of that in Italy not a
vestige is left.</p>

<p>As to this last, which Porsena, King of Etruria, erected as
his intended sepulchre, it is only proper that I should make
some mention of it, if only to show that the vanity displayed
by foreign monarchs, great as it is, has been surpassed. But
as the fabulousness of the story connected with it quite exceeds
all bounds, I shall employ the words given by M. Varro
himself in his account of it:‚Äî‚ÄúPorsena was buried,‚Äù says he,
‚Äúbeneath the city of Clusium;<a id="FNanchor_2604_2604"></a><a href="#Footnote_2604_2604" class="fnanchor">2604</a> in the spot where he had had
constructed a square monument, built of squared stone. Each
side of this monument was three hundred feet in length and
fifty in height, and beneath the base, which was also square,
there was an inextricable labyrinth, into which if any one
entered without a clew of thread, he could never find his way
out. Above this square building there stand five pyramids,
one at each corner, and one in the middle, seventy-five feet
broad at the base, and one hundred and fifty feet in height.
These pyramids are so tapering in their form, that upon the
summit of all of them united there rests a brazen globe, and
upon that a petasus;<a id="FNanchor_2605_2605"></a><a href="#Footnote_2605_2605" class="fnanchor">2605</a> from which there hang, suspended by
chains, bells, which make a tinkling when agitated by the
wind, like what was done at Dodona<a id="FNanchor_2606_2606"></a><a href="#Footnote_2606_2606" class="fnanchor">2606</a> in former times. Upon
this globe there are four other pyramids, each one hundred
feet in height; and above them is a single platform, on which
there are five more pyramids,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2607_2607"></a><a href="#Footnote_2607_2607" class="fnanchor">2607</a>‚Äîthe height of which Varro has
evidently felt ashamed to add; but, according to the Etruscan
fables, it was equal to that of the rest of the building. What
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>downright madness this, to attempt to seek glory at an outlay
which can never be of utility to any one; to say nothing of
exhausting the resources of the kingdom, and after all, that
the artist may reap the greater share of the praise!</p>

<p>We read, too, of hanging gardens,<a id="FNanchor_2608_2608"></a><a href="#Footnote_2608_2608" class="fnanchor">2608</a> and what is even more
than this, a hanging city,<a id="FNanchor_2609_2609"></a><a href="#Footnote_2609_2609" class="fnanchor">2609</a> Thebes in Egypt: it being the practice
for the kings to lead forth their armies from beneath,
while the inhabitants were totally unconscious of it. This, too,
is even less surprising than the fact that a river flows through
the middle of the city. If, however, all this had really been
the case, there is no doubt that Homer would have mentioned
it, he who has celebrated the hundred gates of Thebes.</p>

CHAP. 21. (14.)‚ÄîTHE TEMPLE OF DIANA AT EPHESUS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The most wonderful monument of Gr√¶cian magnificence,
and one that merits our genuine admiration, is the Temple of
Diana at Ephesus, which took one hundred and twenty years
in building, a work in which all Asia<a id="FNanchor_2610_2610"></a><a href="#Footnote_2610_2610" class="fnanchor">2610</a> joined. A marshy soil
was selected for its site, in order that it might not suffer from
earthquakes, or the chasms which they produce. On the
other hand, again, that the foundations of so vast a pile might
not have to rest upon a loose and shifting bed, layers of trodden
charcoal were placed beneath, with fleeces<a id="FNanchor_2611_2611"></a><a href="#Footnote_2611_2611" class="fnanchor">2611</a> covered with wool
upon the top of them. The entire length of the temple is
four hundred and twenty-five feet, and the breadth two hundred
and twenty-five. The columns are one hundred and
twenty-seven in number, and sixty feet in height, each of
them presented by a different king. Thirty-six of these
columns are carved, and one of them by the hand of Scopas.<a id="FNanchor_2612_2612"></a><a href="#Footnote_2612_2612" class="fnanchor">2612</a>
Chersiphron<a id="FNanchor_2613_2613"></a><a href="#Footnote_2613_2613" class="fnanchor">2613</a> was the architect who presided over the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>The great marvel in this building is, how such ponderous
architraves<a id="FNanchor_2614_2614"></a><a href="#Footnote_2614_2614" class="fnanchor">2614</a> could possibly have been raised to so great a
height. This, however, the architect effected by means of
bags filled with sand, which he piled up upon an inclined
plane until they reached beyond the capitals of the columns;
then, as he gradually emptied the lower bags, the architraves<a id="FNanchor_2615_2615"></a><a href="#Footnote_2615_2615" class="fnanchor">2615</a>
insensibly settled in the places assigned them. But the
greatest difficulty of all was found, in laying the lintel which
he placed over the entrance-doors. It was an enormous mass
of stone, and by no possibility could it be brought to lie level
upon the jambs which formed its bed; in consequence of
which, the architect was driven to such a state of anxiety and
desperation as to contemplate suicide. Wearied and quite
worn out by such thoughts as these, during the night, they
say, he beheld in a dream the goddess in honour of whom the
temple was being erected; who exhorted him to live on, for
that she herself had placed the stone in its proper position.
And such, in fact, next morning, was found to be the case,
the stone apparently having come to the proper level by dint
of its own weight. The other decorations of this work would
suffice to fill many volumes, but they do not tend in any way
to illustrate the works of Nature.</p>

<p>There still exists, too, at Cyzicus,<a id="FNanchor_2616_2616"></a><a href="#Footnote_2616_2616" class="fnanchor">2616</a> a temple of polished
stone, between all the joints of which the artist has inserted a
thread of gold; it being his intention to erect an ivory statue
of Jupiter within, with Apollo in marble crowning him. The
result is, that the interstices quite glisten with their fine,
hair-like threads; and the reflection of the gold, obscured as it
is, gently falling upon the statues, besides proclaiming the
genius of the artist, heightens their effect, and so teaches us
to appreciate the costliness of the work.</p>

BUILDINGS ERECTED WITHOUT THE USE OF NAILS.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the same city also, there is a stone, known as the ‚ÄúFugitive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>Stone;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2617_2617"></a><a href="#Footnote_2617_2617" class="fnanchor">2617</a> the Argonaut√¶, who used it for the purposes of
an anchor, having left it there. This stone having repeatedly
taken flight from the Prytan√¶um,<a id="FNanchor_2618_2618"></a><a href="#Footnote_2618_2618" class="fnanchor">2618</a> the place so called where
it is kept, it has been fastened down with lead. In this
city also, near the gate which is known as the ‚ÄúTrachia,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2619_2619"></a><a href="#Footnote_2619_2619" class="fnanchor">2619</a>
there are seven towers, which repeat a number of times all
sounds that are uttered in them. This phenomenon, to which
the name of ‚ÄúEcho,‚Äù has been given by the Greeks, depends
upon the peculiar conformation of localities, and is produced
in valleys more particularly. At Cyzicus, however, it is the
effect of accident only; while at Olympia, it is produced by
artificial means, and in a very marvellous manner; in a portico
there, which is known as the ‚ÄúHeptaphonon,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2620_2620"></a><a href="#Footnote_2620_2620" class="fnanchor">2620</a> from the circumstance
that it returns the sound of the voice seven times.</p>

<p>At Cyzicus, also, is the Buleuterium,<a id="FNanchor_2621_2621"></a><a href="#Footnote_2621_2621" class="fnanchor">2621</a> a vast edifice, constructed
without a nail of iron; the raftering being so contrived
as to admit of the beams being removed and replaced
without the use of stays. A similar thing, too, is the case
with the Sublician Bridge<a id="FNanchor_2622_2622"></a><a href="#Footnote_2622_2622" class="fnanchor">2622</a> at Rome; and this by enactment,

CHAP. 24.‚ÄîMARVELLOUS BUILDINGS AT ROME, EIGHTEEN IN NUMBER.</span></h3></div>

<p>But it is now time to pass on to the marvels in building
displayed by our own City, and to make some enquiry into the
resources and experience that we have gained in the lapse of
eight hundred years; and so prove that here, as well, the rest of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>the world has been outdone by us: a thing which will appear,
in fact, to have occurred almost as many times as the marvels
are in number which I shall have to enumerate. If, indeed,
all the buildings of our City are considered in the aggregate,
and supposing them, so to say, all thrown together in one
vast mass, the united grandeur of them would lead one to
suppose that we were describing another world, accumulated
in a single spot.</p>

<p>Not to mention among our great works, the Circus Maximus,
that was constructed by the Dictator C√¶sar, one stadium
in width and three in length, and occupying, with the adjacent
buildings, no less than four jugera, with room for two
hundred and sixty thousand spectators seated; am I not to
include in the number of our magnificent constructions, the
Basilica of Paulus,<a id="FNanchor_2624_2624"></a><a href="#Footnote_2624_2624" class="fnanchor">2624</a> with its admirable Phrygian columns; the
Forum of the late Emperor Augustus; the Temple of Peace,
erected by the Emperor Vespasianus Augustus‚Äîsome of the
finest works that the world has ever beheld‚Äîthe roofing,
too, of the Vote-Office,<a id="FNanchor_2625_2625"></a><a href="#Footnote_2625_2625" class="fnanchor">2625</a> that was built by Agrippa? not to
forget that, before his time, Valerius of Ostia, the architect,
had covered in a theatre at Rome, at the time of the public
Games celebrated by Libo?<a id="FNanchor_2626_2626"></a><a href="#Footnote_2626_2626" class="fnanchor">2626</a></p>

<p>We behold with admiration pyramids that were built by
kings, when the very ground alone, that was purchased by the
Dictator C√¶sar, for the construction of his Forum, cost one
hundred millions of sesterces! If, too, an enormous expenditure
has its attractions for any one whose mind is influenced
by monetary considerations, be it known to him that the house
in which Clodius dwelt, who was slain by Milo, was purchased
by him at the price of fourteen million eight hundred thousand
sesterces! a thing that, for my part, I look upon as no
less astounding than the monstrous follies that have been displayed
by kings. And then, as to Milo himself, the sums in
which he was indebted, amounted to no less than seventy millions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>of sesterces; a state of things, to be considered, in my
opinion, as one of the most portentous ph√¶nomena in the history
of the human mind. But it was in those days, too, that
old men still spoke in admiration of the vast proportions of
the Agger,<a id="FNanchor_2627_2627"></a><a href="#Footnote_2627_2627" class="fnanchor">2627</a> and of the enormous foundations of the Capitol;
of the public sewers, too, a work more stupendous than any;
as mountains had to be pierced for their construction, and,
like the hanging city<a id="FNanchor_2628_2628"></a><a href="#Footnote_2628_2628" class="fnanchor">2628</a> which we recently mentioned, navigation
had to be carried on beneath Rome; an event which
happened in the √¶dileship<a id="FNanchor_2629_2629"></a><a href="#Footnote_2629_2629" class="fnanchor">2629</a> of M. Agrippa, after he had filled
the office of consul.</p>

<p>For this purpose, there are seven rivers, made, by artificial
channels, to flow beneath the city. Rushing onward, like so
many impetuous torrents, they are compelled to carry off and
sweep away all the sewerage; and swollen as they are by the
vast accession of the pluvial waters, they reverberate against
the sides and bottom of their channels. Occasionally, too,
the Tiber, overflowing, is thrown backward in its course, and
discharges itself by these outlets: obstinate is the contest that
ensues within between the meeting tides, but so firm and solid
is the masonry, that it is enabled to offer an effectual resistance.
Enormous as are the accumulations that are carried along
above, the work of the channels never gives way. Houses
falling spontaneously to ruins, or levelled with the ground
by conflagrations, are continually battering against them;
the ground, too, is shaken by earthquakes every now and
then; and yet, built as they were in the days of Tarquinius
Priscus, seven hundred years ago, these constructions have
survived, all but unharmed. We must not omit, too, to mention
one remarkable circumstance, and all the more remarkable
from the fact, that the most celebrated historians have
omitted to mention it. Tarquinius Priscus having commenced
the sewers, and set the lower classes to work upon them, the
laboriousness and prolonged duration of the employment became
equally an object of dread to them; and the consequence
was, that suicide was a thing of common occurrence, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>citizens adopting this method of escaping their troubles. For
this evil, however, the king devised a singular remedy, and
one that has never<a id="FNanchor_2630_2630"></a><a href="#Footnote_2630_2630" class="fnanchor">2630</a> been resorted to either before that time or
since: for he ordered the bodies of all who had been thus
guilty of self-destruction, to be fastened to a cross, and left
there as a spectacle to their fellow-citizens and a prey
to birds and wild beasts. The result was, that that sense
of propriety which so peculiarly attaches itself to the Roman name,
and which more than once has gained a victory
when the battle was all but lost, came to the rescue on this
occasion as well; though for this once, the Romans were in
reality its dupes, as they forgot that, though they felt shocked
at the thoughts of such ignominy while alive, they would be
quite insensible to any such disgrace when dead. It is said
that Tarquinius made these sewers of dimensions sufficiently
large to admit of a waggon laden with hay passing along them.</p>

<p>All that we have just described, however, is but trifling
when placed in comparison with one marvellous fact, which I
must not omit to mention before I pass on to other subjects.
In the consulship<a id="FNanchor_2631_2631"></a><a href="#Footnote_2631_2631" class="fnanchor">2631</a> of M. Lepidus and Q. Catulus, there was
not at Rome, as we learn from the most trustworthy authors,
a finer house than the one which belonged to Lepidus
himself: and yet, by Hercules! within five-and-thirty years
from that period, the very same house did not hold the hundredth
rank even in the City! Let a person, if he will, in
taking this fact into consideration, only calculate the vast
masses of marble, the productions of painters, the regal treasures
that must have been expended, in bringing these hundred
mansions to vie with one that had been in its day the most sumptuous
and the most celebrated in all the City; and then let
him reflect how that, since that period, and down to the present
time, these houses have all of them been surpassed by
others without number. There can be no doubt that conflagrations
are a punishment inflicted upon us for our luxury;
but such are our habits, that in spite of such warnings as these,
we cannot be made to understand that there are things in existence
more perishable even than man himself.</p>

<p>But there are still two other mansions by which all these
edifices have been eclipsed. Twice have we seen the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>City environed by the palaces of the Emperors Caius<a id="FNanchor_2632_2632"></a><a href="#Footnote_2632_2632" class="fnanchor">2632</a> and
Nero; that of the last, that nothing might be wanting to
its magnificence, being coated with gold.<a id="FNanchor_2633_2633"></a><a href="#Footnote_2633_2633" class="fnanchor">2633</a> Surely such palaces
as these must have been intended for the abode of those who
created this mighty empire, and who left the plough or their
native hearth to go forth to conquer nations, and to return
laden with triumphs! men, in fact, whose very fields even occupied
less space than the audience-chambers<a id="FNanchor_2634_2634"></a><a href="#Footnote_2634_2634" class="fnanchor">2634</a> of these palaces.</p>

<p>Indeed, one cannot but help reflecting how trifling a portion of
these palaces was equal to the sites which the republic granted
to its invincible generals, for the erection of their dwellings.
The supreme honour, too, attendant upon these grants‚Äîas in
the case of P. Valerius Publicola, the first consul with L. Brutus,
for his many meritorious services; and of his brother,
who twice in one consulship defeated the Sabines‚Äîwas the
permission granted, by the terms of the decree, to have the
doors of their houses opening from without, and the gates
thrown back upon the public street. Such was the most distinguished
privilege accorded in those days to triumphal mansions
even!</p>

<p>I will not permit, however, these two Caiuses,<a id="FNanchor_2635_2635"></a><a href="#Footnote_2635_2635" class="fnanchor">2635</a> or two
Neros, to enjoy this glory even, such as it is; for I will prove
that these extravagant follies of theirs have been surpassed, in
the use that was made of his wealth by M. Scaurus, a private
citizen. Indeed, I am by no means certain that it was not
the √¶dileship of this personage that inflicted the first great
blow upon the public manners, and that Sylla was not guilty
of a greater crime in giving such unlimited power to his step-son,<a id="FNanchor_2636_2636"></a><a href="#Footnote_2636_2636" class="fnanchor">2636</a>
than in the proscription of so many thousands. During
his √¶dileship, and only for the temporary purposes of a few
days, Scaurus executed the greatest<a id="FNanchor_2637_2637"></a><a href="#Footnote_2637_2637" class="fnanchor">2637</a> work that has ever been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>made by the hands of man, even when intended to be of everlasting
duration; his Theatre, I mean. This building consisted
of three storeys, supported upon three hundred and
sixty columns; and this, too, in a city which had not allowed
without some censure one of its greatest citizens<a id="FNanchor_2638_2638"></a><a href="#Footnote_2638_2638" class="fnanchor">2638</a> to erect
six<a id="FNanchor_2639_2639"></a><a href="#Footnote_2639_2639" class="fnanchor">2639</a> pillars of Hymettian marble. The ground-storey was of
marble, the second of glass, a species of luxury which ever
since that time has been quite unheard of, and the highest of
gilded wood. The lowermost columns, as previously<a id="FNanchor_2640_2640"></a><a href="#Footnote_2640_2640" class="fnanchor">2640</a> stated,
were eight-and-thirty feet in height; and, placed between
these columns, as already<a id="FNanchor_2641_2641"></a><a href="#Footnote_2641_2641" class="fnanchor">2641</a> mentioned, were brazen statues,
three thousand in number. The area<a id="FNanchor_2642_2642"></a><a href="#Footnote_2642_2642" class="fnanchor">2642</a> of this theatre afforded
accommodation for eighty thousand spectators; and yet the
Theatre of Pompeius, after the City had so greatly increased,
and the inhabitants had become so vastly more numerous, was
considered abundantly large, with its sittings for forty thousand
only. The rest of the fittings of it, what with Attalic<a id="FNanchor_2643_2643"></a><a href="#Footnote_2643_2643" class="fnanchor">2643</a>
vestments, pictures, and the other stage-properties,<a id="FNanchor_2644_2644"></a><a href="#Footnote_2644_2644" class="fnanchor">2644</a> were of
such enormous value that, after Scaurus had had conveyed to
his Tusculan villa such parts thereof as were not required for
the enjoyment of his daily luxuries, the loss was no less than
three hundred millions of sesterces, when the villa was burnt
by his servants in a spirit of revenge.</p>

<p>The consideration of such prodigality as this quite distracts
my attention, and compels me to digress from my original purpose,
in order to mention a still greater instance of extravagance,
in reference to wood. C. Curio,<a id="FNanchor_2645_2645"></a><a href="#Footnote_2645_2645" class="fnanchor">2645</a> who died during the
civil wars, fighting on the side of C√¶sar, found, to his dismay,
that he could not, when celebrating the funeral games in
honour of his father, surpass the riches and magnificence of
Scaurus‚Äîfor where, in fact, was to be found such a stepsire
as Sylla, and such a mother as Metella, that bidder at all
auctions for the property of the proscribed? Where, too, was
he to find for his father, M. Scaurus, so long the principal man
in the city, and one who had acted, in his alliance with Marius,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>as a receptacle for the plunder of whole provinces?‚ÄîIndeed,
Scaurus himself was now no longer able to rival himself; and it
was at least one advantage which he derived from this destruction
by fire of so many objects brought from all parts of the earth,
that no one could ever after be his equal in this species of folly.
Curio, consequently, found himself compelled to fall back upon
his own resources, and to think of some new device of his
own. It is really worth our while to know what this device
was, if only to congratulate ourselves upon the manners of the
present day, and to reverse the ordinary mode of expression,
and term ourselves the men of the olden time.<a id="FNanchor_2646_2646"></a><a href="#Footnote_2646_2646" class="fnanchor">2646</a></p>

<p>He caused to be erected, close together, two theatres of very
large dimensions, and built of wood, each of them nicely poised,
and turning on a pivot. Before mid-day, a spectacle of games
was exhibited in each; the theatres being turned back to back,
in order that the noise of neither of them might interfere with
what was going on in the other. Then, in the latter part of
the day, all on a sudden, the two theatres were swung round,
and, the corners uniting, brought face to face; the outer
frames,<a id="FNanchor_2647_2647"></a><a href="#Footnote_2647_2647" class="fnanchor">2647</a> too, were removed, and thus an amphitheatre was
formed, in which combats of gladiators were presented to the
view; men whose safety was almost less compromised than was
that of the Roman people, in allowing itself to be thus whirled
round from side to side. Now, in this case, which have we
most reason to admire, the inventor or the invention? the artist,
or the author of the project? him who first dared to think of
such an enterprize, or him who ventured to undertake it? him
who obeyed the order, or him who gave it? But the thing that
surpasses all is, the frenzy that must have possessed the public,
to take their seats in a place which must of necessity have been
so unsubstantial and so insecure. Lo and behold! here is a
people that has conquered the whole earth, that has subdued
the universe, that divides the spoils of kingdoms and of nations,
that sends its laws to foreign lands, that shares in some degree
the attributes of the immortal gods in common with mankind,
suspended aloft in a machine, and showering plaudits even upon
its own peril!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>This is indeed holding life cheap; and can we, after this,
complain of our disasters at Cann√¶? How vast the catastrophe
that might have ensued! When cities are swallowed up by
an earthquake, it is looked upon by mankind as a general calamity;
and yet, here have we the whole Roman people, embarked,
so to say, in two ships, and sitting suspended on a
couple of pivots; the grand spectacle being its own struggle
with danger, and its liability to perish at any moment that the
overstrained machinery may give way! And then the object,
too, of all this‚Äîthat public favour may be conciliated for the
tribune‚Äôs<a id="FNanchor_2648_2648"></a><a href="#Footnote_2648_2648" class="fnanchor">2648</a> harangues at a future day, and that, at the Rostra,
he may still have the power of shaking the tribes, nicely
balanced<a id="FNanchor_2649_2649"></a><a href="#Footnote_2649_2649" class="fnanchor">2649</a> as they are! And really, what may he not dare
with those who, at his persuasion, have braved such perils as
these? Indeed, to confess the truth, at the funeral games
celebrated at the tomb of his father, it was no less than the
whole Roman people that shared the dangers of the gladiatorial
combats. When the pivots had now been sufficiently worked
and wearied, he gave another turn to his magnificent displays.
For, upon the last day, still preserving the form of the amphitheatre,
he cut the stage in two through the middle, and exhibited
a spectacle of athletes; after which, the stage being
suddenly withdrawn on either side, he exhibited a combat,
upon the same day, between such of the gladiators as had
previously proved victorious. And yet, with all this, Curio
was no king, no ruler of the destinies of a nation, nor yet a
person remarkable for his opulence even; seeing that he possessed
no resources of his own, beyond what he could realize
from the discord between the leading men.<a id="FNanchor_2650_2650"></a><a href="#Footnote_2650_2650" class="fnanchor">2650</a></p>

<p>But let us now turn our attention to some marvels which,
justly appreciated, may be truthfully pronounced to remain
unsurpassed. Q. Marcius Rex,<a id="FNanchor_2651_2651"></a><a href="#Footnote_2651_2651" class="fnanchor">2651</a> upon being commanded by
the senate to repair the Appian<a id="FNanchor_2652_2652"></a><a href="#Footnote_2652_2652" class="fnanchor">2652</a> Aqueduct, and those of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>Anio<a id="FNanchor_2653_2653"></a><a href="#Footnote_2653_2653" class="fnanchor">2653</a> and Tepula,<a id="FNanchor_2654_2654"></a><a href="#Footnote_2654_2654" class="fnanchor">2654</a> constructed during his pr√¶torship a new
aqueduct,<a id="FNanchor_2655_2655"></a><a href="#Footnote_2655_2655" class="fnanchor">2655</a> which bore his name, and was brought hither by a
channel pierced through the sides of mountains. Agrippa,<a id="FNanchor_2656_2656"></a><a href="#Footnote_2656_2656" class="fnanchor">2656</a>
in his √¶dileship, united the Marcian with the Virgin<a id="FNanchor_2657_2657"></a><a href="#Footnote_2657_2657" class="fnanchor">2657</a> Aqueduct,
and repaired and strengthened the channels of the others.
He also formed seven hundred wells, in addition to five hundred
fountains, and one hundred and thirty reservoirs, many
of them magnificently adorned. Upon these works, too, he
erected three hundred statues of marble or bronze, and four
hundred marble columns; and all this in the space of a single
year! In the work<a id="FNanchor_2658_2658"></a><a href="#Footnote_2658_2658" class="fnanchor">2658</a> which he has written in commemoration
of his √¶dileship, he also informs us that public games were
celebrated for the space of fifty-nine days, and that one hundred
and seventy gratuitous baths were opened. The number
of these last at Rome, has increased to an infinite<a id="FNanchor_2659_2659"></a><a href="#Footnote_2659_2659" class="fnanchor">2659</a> extent
since his time.</p>

<p>The preceding aqueducts, however, have all been surpassed
by the costly work which was more recently commenced by
the Emperor Caius,<a id="FNanchor_2660_2660"></a><a href="#Footnote_2660_2660" class="fnanchor">2660</a> and completed by Claudius. Under these
princes, the Curtian and C√¶rulean Waters, with the New
Anio,<a id="FNanchor_2661_2661"></a><a href="#Footnote_2661_2661" class="fnanchor">2661</a> were brought from a distance of forty miles, and at so
high a level that all the hills were supplied with water, on
which the City is built. The sum expended on these works
was three hundred and fifty millions of sesterces. If we only
take into consideration the abundant supply of water to the
public, for baths, ponds, canals, household purposes, gardens,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>places in the suburbs, and country-houses; and then reflect
upon the distances that are traversed, the arches that have been
constructed, the mountains that have been pierced, the valleys
that have been levelled, we must of necessity admit that there
is nothing to be found more worthy of our admiration throughout
the whole universe.</p>

<p>Among the most memorable works, too, I, for my own part,
should include another undertaking of the Emperor Claudius,
although it was afterwards abandoned in consequence of the
hatred borne him by his successor;<a id="FNanchor_2662_2662"></a><a href="#Footnote_2662_2662" class="fnanchor">2662</a> I mean the channel that
was cut through a mountain as an emissary for Lake Fucinus;<a id="FNanchor_2663_2663"></a><a href="#Footnote_2663_2663" class="fnanchor">2663</a>
a work which cost a sum beyond all calculation, and employed
a countless multitude of workmen for many years. In those
parts where the soil was found to be terreous, it was necessary
to pump up the water by the aid of machinery; in other parts,
again, the solid rock had to be hewn through. All this, too,
had to be done in the midst of darkness within; a series of
operations which can only be adequately conceived by those
who were witnesses of them, and which no human language
can possibly describe.</p>

<p>I pass in silence the harbour that has been formed at Ostia;
the various roads, too, that have been cut across mountains;
the Tyrrhenian Sea separated by an embankment from Lake
Lucrinus;<a id="FNanchor_2664_2664"></a><a href="#Footnote_2664_2664" class="fnanchor">2664</a> and vast numbers of bridges constructed at an
enormous expense. Among the many other marvels, too, of
Italy, we are informed by Papirius Fabianus, a most diligent
enquirer into the operations of Nature, that the marble there
grows in the quarries; and those who work in the quarries
assure us that the wounds thus inflicted upon the mountains
fill up spontaneously. If such is the fact, luxury has good
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>grounds for hoping that it will never be at a loss for a supply
of materials for its gratification.</p>

CHAP. 25. (16.)‚ÄîTHE MAGNET: THREE REMEDIES</span></h3></div>

<p>Upon quitting the marbles to pass on to the other more
remarkable stones, who can for a moment doubt that the
magnet<a id="FNanchor_2665_2665"></a><a href="#Footnote_2665_2665" class="fnanchor">2665</a> will be the first to suggest itself? For what, in fact,
is there endowed with more marvellous properties than this?
or in which of her departments has Nature displayed a greater
degree of waywardness? She had given a voice to rocks, as
already<a id="FNanchor_2666_2666"></a><a href="#Footnote_2666_2666" class="fnanchor">2666</a> mentioned, and had enabled them to answer man, or
rather, I should say, to throw back his own words in his teeth.
What is there in existence more inert than a piece of rigid
stone? And yet, behold! Nature has here endowed stone with
both sense and hands. What is there more stubborn than
hard iron? Nature has, in this instance, bestowed upon it both
feet and intelligence. It allows itself, in fact, to be attracted
by the magnet, and, itself a metal which subdues all other elements,
it precipitates itself towards the source of an influence
at once mysterious and unseen. The moment the metal comes
near it, it springs towards the magnet, and, as it clasps it,
is held fast in the magnet‚Äôs embraces. Hence it is that this
stone is sometimes known by the name of ‚Äúsideritis;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2667_2667"></a><a href="#Footnote_2667_2667" class="fnanchor">2667</a> another
name given to it being ‚Äúheraclion.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2668_2668"></a><a href="#Footnote_2668_2668" class="fnanchor">2668</a> It received its name
‚Äúmagnes,‚Äù Nicander informs us, from the person who was the
first to discover it, upon Ida.<a id="FNanchor_2669_2669"></a><a href="#Footnote_2669_2669" class="fnanchor">2669</a> It is found, too, in various
other countries, as in Spain, for example. Magnes, it is said,
made this discovery, when, upon taking his herds to pasture,
he found that the nails of his shoes and the iron ferrel of his
staff adhered to the ground.</p>

<p>Sotacus<a id="FNanchor_2670_2670"></a><a href="#Footnote_2670_2670" class="fnanchor">2670</a> describes five<a id="FNanchor_2671_2671"></a><a href="#Footnote_2671_2671" class="fnanchor">2671</a> different kinds of magnet; the
√Üthiopian magnet; that of Magnesia, a country which borders
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>on Macedonia, and lies to the right of the road which leads from,
the town of B≈ìbe to Iolcos; a third, from Hyettus in B≈ìotia;
a fourth, from Alexandria in Troas; and a fifth, from Magnesia
in Asia. The leading distinction in magnets is the sex, male
and female,<a id="FNanchor_2672_2672"></a><a href="#Footnote_2672_2672" class="fnanchor">2672</a> and the next great difference in them is the
colour. Those of Magnesia, bordering on Macedonia, are of
a reddish black; those of B≈ìotia are more red than black; and
the kind that is found in Troas is black, of the female sex,
and consequently destitute of attractive power. The most
inferior, however, of all, are those of Magnesia in Asia: they
are white, have no attractive influence on iron, and resemble
pumice in appearance. It has been found by experience, that
the more nearly the magnet approaches to an azure colour,
the better it is in quality. The √Üthiopian magnet is looked
upon as the best of all, and is purchased at its weight in silver:
Zmiris in √Üthiopia is the place where it is found, such being
the name of a region there, covered with sand.</p>

<p>In the same country, too, the magnet called ‚Äúh√¶matites‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2673_2673"></a><a href="#Footnote_2673_2673" class="fnanchor">2673</a> is
found, a stone of a blood-red colour, and which, when bruised,
yields a tint like that of blood, as also of saffron. The
h√¶matites has not the same property<a id="FNanchor_2674_2674"></a><a href="#Footnote_2674_2674" class="fnanchor">2674</a> of attracting iron that
the ordinary magnet has. The √Üthiopian magnet is recognized
by this peculiarity, that it has the property, also, of
attracting other magnets to it.<a id="FNanchor_2675_2675"></a><a href="#Footnote_2675_2675" class="fnanchor">2675</a> All these minerals are useful
as ingredients in ophthalmic preparations, in certain proportions
according to the nature of each: they are particularly
good, too, for arresting defluxions of the eyes. Triturated in
a calcined state, they have a healing effect upon burns.</p>

<p>In √Üthiopia, too, not far from Zmiris, there is a mountain
in which the stone called ‚Äútheamedes‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2676_2676"></a><a href="#Footnote_2676_2676" class="fnanchor">2676</a> is found, a mineral
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>which repels and rejects all kinds of iron. Of the attractive and
repulsive properties of iron, we have spoken<a id="FNanchor_2677_2677"></a><a href="#Footnote_2677_2677" class="fnanchor">2677</a> more than once.</p>

dead bodies, when buried in this stone, are consumed in the
course of forty days, with the sole exception of the teeth.
According to Mucianus, too, mirrors, body-scrapers, garments,
and shoes, that have been buried with the dead, become transformed
into stone. In Lycia, and in the East, there are certain
stones of a similar nature, which, when attached to the bodies
of the living even, corrode the flesh.</p>

<p>Less active in its properties is chernites,<a id="FNanchor_2681_2681"></a><a href="#Footnote_2681_2681" class="fnanchor">2681</a> a stone which
preserves bodies without consuming them, and strongly resembles
ivory in appearance: the body of King Darius, they say,
was buried in it. The stone that is known as ‚Äúporus,‚Äù<a href="#Footnote_2681_2681" class="fnanchor">2681</a> is
similar to Parian marble in hardness and whiteness, but is not
so heavy. Theophrastus mentions also a transparent stone
that is found in Egypt, and is similar to stone of Chios in
appearance; it is by no means improbable that it may have
existed in his time, for stones, we know, disappear, and new
kinds are discovered. The stone of Assos,<a id="FNanchor_2682_2682"></a><a href="#Footnote_2682_2682" class="fnanchor">2682</a> which is saltish
to the taste, modifies the attacks of gout, the feet being placed
in a vessel made of it for the purpose; in addition to which,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>in the quarries of this stone, all maladies of the legs disappear,
whereas, in mines in general, the legs become affected with
disease. ‚ÄúFlower of stone of Assos‚Äù is the name given to
a soft stone which crumbles into dust, and is found very efficacious
in some cases; it resembles red pumice in appearance.
In combination with Cyprian wax, this stone is curative of affections
of the mamill√¶; and, employed with pitch or resin, it
disperses scrofulous sores and inflammatory tumours. Used in
the form of an electuary, it is good for phthisis, and, with honey,
it causes old sores to cicatrize, and consumes proud flesh. It
is used, also, for the cure of wounds of an obstinate nature
inflicted by animals, and acts as a desiccative upon suppurations.
Plaisters, too, are made of it for gout, bean-meal being
incorporated with it for the purpose.</p>

<p>Theophrastus and Mucianus are of opinion that there are
certain stones which bring<a id="FNanchor_2683_2683"></a><a href="#Footnote_2683_2683" class="fnanchor">2683</a> forth other stones. Theophrastus
states, also, that a fossil<a id="FNanchor_2684_2684"></a><a href="#Footnote_2684_2684" class="fnanchor">2684</a> ivory is found, both white and
black; that the earth, too, produces bones, and that osseous<a id="FNanchor_2685_2685"></a><a href="#Footnote_2685_2685" class="fnanchor">2685</a>
stones are sometimes found. In the vicinity of Munda in
Spain, the place where the Dictator C√¶sar defeated Pompeius,<a id="FNanchor_2686_2686"></a><a href="#Footnote_2686_2686" class="fnanchor">2686</a>
there are stones found, which, when broken asunder, bear the
impression of palm leaves.<a id="FNanchor_2687_2687"></a><a href="#Footnote_2687_2687" class="fnanchor">2687</a></p>

<p>There are some black stones, also, which are held in much
the same esteem as the marbles; the T√¶narian<a id="FNanchor_2688_2688"></a><a href="#Footnote_2688_2688" class="fnanchor">2688</a> stone, for
example. Varro says that the black stone of Africa is more
durable than that of Italy; while, on the other hand, the white
corani<a id="FNanchor_2689_2689"></a><a href="#Footnote_2689_2689" class="fnanchor">2689</a> are harder than Parian marble. He states, also, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>the silex of Luna admits of being cut with a saw; that that
of Tusculum decrepitates in the fire; that the tawny silex of
the Sabine districts, with the addition of oil, will yield a flame
even; and that, at Volsinii, molar stones<a id="FNanchor_2690_2690"></a><a href="#Footnote_2690_2690" class="fnanchor">2690</a> for grinding are
found. Among the prodigies that have happened, I find mention

CHAP. 30.‚ÄîMOLAR STONES. PYRITES; SEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>In no country are the molar stones<a id="FNanchor_2691_2691"></a><a href="#Footnote_2691_2691" class="fnanchor">2691</a> superior to those of
Italy; stones, be it remembered, and not fragments of rock:
there are some provinces, too, where they are not to be found
at all. Some stones of this class are softer than others, and
admit of being smoothed with the whetstone, so as to present
all the appearance, at a distance, of ophites.<a id="FNanchor_2692_2692"></a><a href="#Footnote_2692_2692" class="fnanchor">2692</a> There is no
stone of a more durable nature than this; for in general, stone,
like wood, suffers from the action, more or less, of rain, heat,
and cold. Some kinds, again, become deteriorated by the action
of the moon, while others are apt to contract a rust in lapse of
time, or to change their white colour when steeped in oil.</p>

<p>(19.) Some persons give this molar stone the name of
‚Äúpyrites,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2693_2693"></a><a href="#Footnote_2693_2693" class="fnanchor">2693</a> from the circumstance that it has a great affinity
to fire;<a id="FNanchor_2694_2694"></a><a href="#Footnote_2694_2694" class="fnanchor">2694</a> but there is also another kind of pyrites, of a more
porous nature, and another,<a id="FNanchor_2695_2695"></a><a href="#Footnote_2695_2695" class="fnanchor">2695</a> again, which resembles copper.
This last, it is said, is found in the mines, near Acamas,<a id="FNanchor_2696_2696"></a><a href="#Footnote_2696_2696" class="fnanchor">2696</a> in the
Isle of Cyprus; one variety of it being of a silver, another of a
golden, colour. There are various methods of melting these
stones, some persons fusing them twice, or three times even, in
honey, till all the liquid has evaporated; while others, again,
calcine them upon hot coals, and, after treating them with
honey, wash them like copper.</p>

<p>The medicinal properties which these minerals possess are of
a calorific, desiccative, dispersive, and resolvent nature, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>applied topically, they case indurations to suppurate. They
are employed also, in a crude state and pulverized, for the
cure of scrofulous sores and boils. Some writers mention
another kind of pyrites also. Those among them have the
greatest affinity to fire which we distinguish as ‚Äúlive‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2697_2697"></a><a href="#Footnote_2697_2697" class="fnanchor">2697</a>
pyrites. They are the most ponderous of all, and are found
remarkably useful for advance-guards when laying out encampments;
for, on being struck with a nail or any other kind of stone,
they emit a spark, which, received upon sulphur, dried fungus,<a id="FNanchor_2698_2698"></a><a href="#Footnote_2698_2698" class="fnanchor">2698</a>
or leaves, produces a fire almost sooner than it could be named.</p>

just the colour<a id="FNanchor_2717_2717"></a><a href="#Footnote_2717_2717" class="fnanchor">2717</a> of minium.<a id="FNanchor_2718_2718"></a><a href="#Footnote_2718_2718" class="fnanchor">2718</a> It is calcined in the same
manner as Phrygian stone, but is not quenched in wine. Adulterations
of it are detected by the appearance of red veins in it,
and by its comparative friability. It is marvellously useful as
an application for bloodshot eyes, and, taken internally, it acts
as a check upon female discharges. To patients vomiting
blood, it is administered in combination with pomegranate-juice.
It is very efficacious also for affections of the bladder;
and it is taken with wine for the cure of wounds inflicted by
serpents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span>
In all those cases the stone called ‚Äúschistos‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2719_2719"></a><a href="#Footnote_2719_2719" class="fnanchor">2719</a> is efficacious,
though not in so high a degree as the other; the most serviceable
being that which resembles saffron in colour. Applied
with woman‚Äôs milk, it is particularly useful for arresting discharges
from the corners of the eyes,<a id="FNanchor_2720_2720"></a><a href="#Footnote_2720_2720" class="fnanchor">2720</a> and it is also very
serviceable for reducing procidence of those organs. Such, at
least, is the opinion of the authors who have most recently
written on the subject.</p>

ARABIAN H√ÜMATITES. MILTITES OR HEPATITES. ANTHRACITES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Sotacus, one of the most ancient writers, says, that there are
five kinds of h√¶matites, in addition to the magnet<a id="FNanchor_2721_2721"></a><a href="#Footnote_2721_2721" class="fnanchor">2721</a> so called.
He gives the preference among them to that of √Üthiopia,<a id="FNanchor_2722_2722"></a><a href="#Footnote_2722_2722" class="fnanchor">2722</a> a
very useful ingredient in ophthalmic preparations and the compositions
which he calls ‚Äúpanchresta,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2723_2723"></a><a href="#Footnote_2723_2723" class="fnanchor">2723</a> and good for the cure of
burns. The second, he says, is called ‚Äúandrodamas,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2724_2724"></a><a href="#Footnote_2724_2724" class="fnanchor">2724</a> of a
black<a id="FNanchor_2725_2725"></a><a href="#Footnote_2725_2725" class="fnanchor">2725</a> colour, remarkable for its weight and hardness, to which
it owes its name, in fact, and found in Africa more particularly.
It attracts silver, he says, copper, and iron, and is tested with
a touchstone made of basanites.<a id="FNanchor_2726_2726"></a><a href="#Footnote_2726_2726" class="fnanchor">2726</a> It yields a liquid the colour
of blood, and is an excellent remedy for diseases of the liver.
The third kind that he mentions is the h√¶matites<a id="FNanchor_2727_2727"></a><a href="#Footnote_2727_2727" class="fnanchor">2727</a> of Arabia, a
mineral of equal hardness, and which with difficulty yields,
upon the water-whetstone, a liquid sometimes approaching the
tint of saffron. The fourth<a id="FNanchor_2728_2728"></a><a href="#Footnote_2728_2728" class="fnanchor">2728</a> kind, he says, is known as ‚Äúhepatites,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2729_2729"></a><a href="#Footnote_2729_2729" class="fnanchor">2729</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">364</a></span>while raw, and as ‚Äúmiltites‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2730_2730"></a><a href="#Footnote_2730_2730" class="fnanchor">2730</a> when calcined; a substance
good for burns, and more efficacious than rubrica<a id="FNanchor_2731_2731"></a><a href="#Footnote_2731_2731" class="fnanchor">2731</a> for all
the purposes for which that mineral is employed. The fifth<a id="FNanchor_2732_2732"></a><a href="#Footnote_2732_2732" class="fnanchor">2732</a>
variety is schistos; a substance which, taken internally, arrests
h√¶morrhoidal discharges. Upon the same authority, it is recommended
to take any kind of h√¶matites, fasting, in doses of
three drachm√¶, triturated in oil, for affections of the blood.<a id="FNanchor_2733_2733"></a><a href="#Footnote_2733_2733" class="fnanchor">2733</a></p>

<p>The same author mentions also a kind of schistos which has no
affinity to h√¶matites, and to which he gives the name of ‚Äúanthracites.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2734_2734"></a><a href="#Footnote_2734_2734" class="fnanchor">2734</a>
It is a native of Africa, he says, and is of a
black colour. When rubbed upon a water-whetstone, it yields
a black colour on the side which has adhered to the earth, and,
on the opposite side, a saffron tint. He states also that it is a
useful ingredient in ophthalmic preparations.</p>

CHAP. 39. (21)‚ÄîA√ãTITES. TAPHIUSIAN STONE. CALLIMUS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The stone called a√´tites<a id="FNanchor_2735_2735"></a><a href="#Footnote_2735_2735" class="fnanchor">2735</a> has a great reputation, in consequence
of the name which it bears. It is found in the nests
of eagles, as already mentioned in our Tenth Book.<a id="FNanchor_2736_2736"></a><a href="#Footnote_2736_2736" class="fnanchor">2736</a> There
are always two of these stones found together, they say, a male
stone and a female; and without them, it is said, the various
eagles that we have described would be unable to propagate.
Hence it is, too, that the young of the eagle are never more
than two in number. There are four varieties of the a√´tites:
that of Africa is soft and diminutive, and contains in the
interior‚Äîin its bowels as it were‚Äîa sweet, white, argillaceous
earth. It is friable, and is generally thought to be of the
female sex. The male stone, on the other hand, which is found
in Arabia, is hard, and similar to a nut-gall in appearance;
or else of a reddish hue, with a hard stone in the interior. The
third kind is a stone found in the Isle of Cyprus, and resembles
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">365</a></span>those of Africa in appearance, but is larger and flat, while the
others are of a globular form: it contains a sand within, of a
pleasing colour, and mixed with small stones; being so soft
itself as to admit of being crushed between the fingers.</p>

<p>The fourth variety is known as the Taphiusian a√´tites, and
is found near Leucas,<a id="FNanchor_2737_2737"></a><a href="#Footnote_2737_2737" class="fnanchor">2737</a> at Taphiusa, a locality which lies to
the right as you sail from Ithaca towards Cape Leucas. It is
met with in the beds of rivers there, and is white and round;
having another stone in the interior, the name given to which
is ‚Äúcallimus:‚Äù none of the varieties of a√´tites have a smoother
surface than this. Attached to pregnant women or to cattle,
in the skins of animals that have been sacrificed, these stones
act as a preventive of abortion, care being taken not to remove
them till the moment of parturition; for otherwise procidence
of the uterus is the result. If, on the other hand, they are not
removed at the moment when parturition is about to ensue,
that operation of Nature cannot be effected.</p>

the earth in praise of which we have spoken already.<a id="FNanchor_2739_2739"></a><a href="#Footnote_2739_2739" class="fnanchor">2739</a>  It is

in manner already<a id="FNanchor_2740_2740"></a><a href="#Footnote_2740_2740" class="fnanchor">2740</a> described. It is good, too, for watery discharges
of a chronic nature, from the eyes. Taken internally,
it is useful for affections of the stomach, and it has the effect
of dispelling vertigo and restoring the spirits when depressed.
Some writers are of opinion that this stone may be administered
with advantage for epilepsy and strangury; and it is employed
as an ingredient in the restoratives known as ‚Äúacopa.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2741_2741"></a><a href="#Footnote_2741_2741" class="fnanchor">2741</a> The

<p>And here, too, I must not omit to give some account of
pumice.<a id="FNanchor_2744_2744"></a><a href="#Footnote_2744_2744" class="fnanchor">2744</a> This name is very generally given, it is true, to those
porous pieces of stone, which we see suspended in the erections
known as ‚Äúmus√¶a,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2745_2745"></a><a href="#Footnote_2745_2745" class="fnanchor">2745</a> with the view of artificially
giving them all the appearance of caverns. But the genuine
pumice-stones, that are in use for imparting smoothness to the
skin of females, and not females only, but men as well, and, as
Catullus<a id="FNanchor_2746_2746"></a><a href="#Footnote_2746_2746" class="fnanchor">2746</a> says, for polishing books, are found of the finest quality
in the islands of Melos and Nisyros<a id="FNanchor_2747_2747"></a><a href="#Footnote_2747_2747" class="fnanchor">2747</a>  and in the √Üolian Isles.
To be good, they should be white, as light as possible, porous and
dry in the extreme, friable, and free from sand when rubbed.</p>

<p>Considered medicinally, pumice is of a resolvent and desiccative
nature; for which purpose it is submitted to calcination,
no less than three times, on a fire of pure charcoal, it being
quenched as often in white wine. It is then washed, like
cadmia,<a id="FNanchor_2748_2748"></a><a href="#Footnote_2748_2748" class="fnanchor">2748</a> and, after being dried, is put by for keeping, in a
place as free from damp as possible. In a powdered state,
pumice is used in ophthalmic preparations more particularly,
and acts as a lenitive detergent upon ulcerations of the eyes.
It also makes new flesh upon cicatrizations of those organs,
and removes all traces of the marks. Some prefer, after the
third calcination, leaving the pumice to cool, and then triturating
it in wine. It is employed also as an ingredient in emollient
poultices, being extremely useful for ulcerations on the head
and generative organs; dentifrices, too, are prepared from it.
According to Theophrastus,<a id="FNanchor_2749_2749"></a><a href="#Footnote_2749_2749" class="fnanchor">2749</a> persons when drinking for a wager
are in the habit<a id="FNanchor_2750_2750"></a><a href="#Footnote_2750_2750" class="fnanchor">2750</a> of taking powdered pumice first; but they
run great risk, he says, if they fail to swallow the whole
draught of wine at once; it being of so refrigerative a nature
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">367</a></span>that grape-juice<a id="FNanchor_2751_2751"></a><a href="#Footnote_2751_2751" class="fnanchor">2751</a> will absolutely cease to boil if pumice is put

OTHER PURPOSES. ETESIAN STONE. THEBAIC STONE. CHALAZIAN
STONE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Authors, too, have paid some attention to the stones in use
for mortars, not only those employed for the trituration of
drugs and pigments, but for other purposes as well. In this
respect they have given the preference to Etesian<a id="FNanchor_2752_2752"></a><a href="#Footnote_2752_2752" class="fnanchor">2752</a> stone before
all others, and, next to that, to Thebaic stone, already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_2753_2753"></a><a href="#Footnote_2753_2753" class="fnanchor">2753</a>
as being called ‚Äúpyrrhop≈ìcilon,‚Äù and known as ‚Äúpsaranus‚Äù
by some. The third rank has been assigned to chrysites,<a id="FNanchor_2754_2754"></a><a href="#Footnote_2754_2754" class="fnanchor">2754</a>
a stone nearly allied to Chalazian<a id="FNanchor_2755_2755"></a><a href="#Footnote_2755_2755" class="fnanchor">2755</a> stone. For medicinal
purposes, however, basanites<a id="FNanchor_2756_2756"></a><a href="#Footnote_2756_2756" class="fnanchor">2756</a> has been preferred, this being a
stone that remits no particles from its surface.<a id="FNanchor_2757_2757"></a><a href="#Footnote_2757_2757" class="fnanchor">2757</a></p>

<p>Those stones which yield a liquid, are generally looked upon
as good for the trituration of ophthalmic preparations; and
hence it is, that the √Üthiopian stone is so much in request for
the purpose. T√¶narian stone, they say, Ph≈ìnician stone, and
h√¶matites, are good for the preparation of those medicinal
compositions in which saffron forms an ingredient; but they
also speak of another T√¶narian stone, of a dark colour, which,
like Parian<a id="FNanchor_2758_2758"></a><a href="#Footnote_2758_2758" class="fnanchor">2758</a> stone, is not so well adapted for medicinal purposes.
We learn from them, too, that Egyptian alabastrites,<a id="FNanchor_2759_2759"></a><a href="#Footnote_2759_2759" class="fnanchor">2759</a>
or white ophites,<a id="FNanchor_2760_2760"></a><a href="#Footnote_2760_2760" class="fnanchor">2760</a> from the virtues inherent in them, are considered
still better adapted for these purposes than the kinds
last mentioned. It is this kind of ophites, too, from which
vessels, and casks even, are made.</p>

<p>At Siphnos,<a id="FNanchor_2761_2761"></a><a href="#Footnote_2761_2761" class="fnanchor">2761</a> there is a kind of stone<a id="FNanchor_2762_2762"></a><a href="#Footnote_2762_2762" class="fnanchor">2762</a> which is hollowed
and turned in the lathe, for making cooking-utensils and vessels
for keeping provisions; a thing too, that, to my own knowledge,<a id="FNanchor_2763_2763"></a><a href="#Footnote_2763_2763" class="fnanchor">2763</a>
is done with the green stone<a id="FNanchor_2764_2764"></a><a href="#Footnote_2764_2764" class="fnanchor">2764</a> of Comum<a id="FNanchor_2765_2765"></a><a href="#Footnote_2765_2765" class="fnanchor">2765</a> in Italy.
With reference, however, to the stone of Siphnos, it is a singular
fact, that, when heated in oil, though naturally very soft,
it becomes hard and black; so great a difference is there in
the qualities of stone.</p>

<p>There are some remarkable instances, too, beyond the Alps, of
the natural softness of some kinds of stone. In the province
of the Belg√¶, there is a white stone<a id="FNanchor_2766_2766"></a><a href="#Footnote_2766_2766" class="fnanchor">2766</a> which admits of being cut
with the saw that is used for wood, and with greater facility
even. This stone is used as a substitute for roof-tiles and
gutter-tiles, and even for the kind of roofing known as the
pavonaceous<a id="FNanchor_2767_2767"></a><a href="#Footnote_2767_2767" class="fnanchor">2767</a> style, if that is preferred. Such are the stones
that admit of being cut into thin slabs.</p>

<p>As to specular<a id="FNanchor_2768_2768"></a><a href="#Footnote_2768_2768" class="fnanchor">2768</a> stone‚Äîfor this, too, is ranked as one of the
stones‚Äîit admits of being divided with still greater facility,
and can be split into leaves as thin as may be desired. The
province of Nearer Spain used formerly to be the only one
that furnished it‚Äînot, indeed, the whole of that country, but
a district extending for a hundred miles around the city of
Segobrica.<a id="FNanchor_2769_2769"></a><a href="#Footnote_2769_2769" class="fnanchor">2769</a> But at the present day, Cyprus, Cappadocia, and
Sicily, supply us with it; and, still more recently, it has been
discovered in Africa: they are all, however, looked upon as
inferior to the stone which comes from Spain. The sheets
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">369</a></span>from Cappadocia are the largest in size; but then they are
clouded. This stone is to be found also in the territory of
Bononia,<a id="FNanchor_2770_2770"></a><a href="#Footnote_2770_2770" class="fnanchor">2770</a> in Italy; but in small pieces only, covered with
spots and encrusted in a bed of silex, there being a considerable
affinity, it would appear, in their nature.</p>

<p>In Spain, the specular-stone is extracted from shafts sunk
in the earth to a very considerable depth; though it is occasionally
to be found just beneath the surface, enclosed in the
solid rock, and extracted without difficulty, or else cut away
from its bed. In most cases, however, it admits of being dug
up, being of an isolated nature, and lying in pieces, like rag-stone,
but never known as yet to exceed five feet in length.
It would appear that this substance is originally a liquid,
which, by an animating power in the earth, becomes congealed
like crystal; and it is very evident that it is the result of petrifaction,
from the fact that, when animals have fallen into the
shafts from which it is extracted, the marrow of their bones
becomes transformed into stone of a similar nature, by the end
of a single winter. In some cases, too, it is found of a black
colour: but the white stone has the marvellous property, soft
as it is known to be, of resisting the action of the sun and of
cold. Nor will it, if it is only protected from accidents,
become deteriorated by lapse of time, a thing that is so generally
the case with many other kinds of stone that are used
for building purposes. The shavings, too, and scales of this
stone, have been used of late for another purpose; the Circus
Maximus having been strewed with them at the celebration of
the games, with the object of producing an agreeable whiteness.</p>

<p>During the reign of Nero, there was a stone found in Cappadocia,

for it the name of ‚Äúphengites.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2771_2771"></a><a href="#Footnote_2771_2771" class="fnanchor">2771</a> It was with this stone<a id="FNanchor_2772_2772"></a><a href="#Footnote_2772_2772" class="fnanchor">2772</a>

CHAP. 47.‚ÄîWHETSTONES.</span></h3></div>

<p>We must now pass on to the stones that are employed for
handicrafts, and, first of all, whetstones for sharpening iron.
Of these stones there are numerous varieties; the Cretan stones
having been long held in the highest estimation, and the next
best being those of Mount Taygetus, in Laconia; both of
which are used as hones, and require oil. Among the water-whetstones,
the first rank belonged to those of Naxos, and the
second to the stones of Armenia, both of them already<a id="FNanchor_2776_2776"></a><a href="#Footnote_2776_2776" class="fnanchor">2776</a> mentioned.
The stones of Cilicia are of excellent quality, whether
used with oil or with water; those of Arsin√∂e,<a id="FNanchor_2777_2777"></a><a href="#Footnote_2777_2777" class="fnanchor">2777</a> too, are very
good, but with water only. Whetstones have been found also
in Italy, which with water give a remarkably keen edge; and
from the countries beyond the Alps, we have the whetstones
known as ‚Äúpassernices.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2778_2778"></a><a href="#Footnote_2778_2778" class="fnanchor">2778</a></p>

<p>To the fourth class belong the hones which give an edge
by the agency of human saliva, and are much in use in barbers‚Äô
shops. They are worthless, however, for all other purposes,
in consequence of their soft and brittle nature: those
from the district of Laminium,<a id="FNanchor_2779_2779"></a><a href="#Footnote_2779_2779" class="fnanchor">2779</a> in Nearer Spain, are the best
of the kind.</p>

there is tophus;<a id="FNanchor_2780_2780"></a><a href="#Footnote_2780_2780" class="fnanchor">2780</a> material totally unsuited for building
purposes, in consequence of its perishableness. Still, however,
there are some localities which have no other, Carthage,
in Africa, for example. It is eaten away by the emanations
from the sea, crumbled to dust by the wind, and shattered by
the pelting of the rain: but human industry has found the
means of protecting walls of houses built of it, with a coating of
pitch, as a plaster of lime would corrode it. Hence it is,
that we have the well-known saying, ‚Äúthat the Carthaginians
use pitch<a id="FNanchor_2781_2781"></a><a href="#Footnote_2781_2781" class="fnanchor">2781</a> for their houses and lime<a id="FNanchor_2782_2782"></a><a href="#Footnote_2782_2782" class="fnanchor">2782</a> for their wines,‚Äù this
last being the method used by them in the preparation of their
must.</p>

<p>In the territories of Fiden√¶ and Alba, in the vicinity of
Rome, we find other soft kinds of stone; and, in Umbria and
Venetia, there is a stone<a id="FNanchor_2783_2783"></a><a href="#Footnote_2783_2783" class="fnanchor">2783</a> which admits of being cut with the
teeth of a saw. These stones are easy to be worked, and are

kept sheltered from the weather. Rain, however, frost, and dew,
split them to pieces, nor can they resist the humidity of the
sea-air. The stone<a id="FNanchor_2784_2784"></a><a href="#Footnote_2784_2784" class="fnanchor">2784</a> of Tibur can stand everything except

<p>The black silex<a id="FNanchor_2785_2785"></a><a href="#Footnote_2785_2785" class="fnanchor">2785</a> is in general the best; but in some localities,

moulds, too, are made from them, for the purpose of fusing
copper. There is a green silex, also, which offers a most
powerful resistance to the action of fire, but is never found in
any large quantities, and, in all cases, in an isolated form, and
not as a constituent part of solid rock. Of the other kinds,
the pale silex is but rarely used for erections: being of globular
form, it is not liable to injury, but at the same time it is
insecure for building purposes, unless it is well braced and
tightly held together. Nor yet does river silex offer any
greater security, for it always has the appearance of being
wet.</p>

<p>When the nature of stone is doubtful, the proper precaution
is, to quarry it in summer, and not to use it for building before
the end of a couple of years, leaving it in the meantime to
be well seasoned by the weather. The slabs which have been
damaged will be found to be better suited for the foundations
under ground: while those, on the other hand, which have remained
uninjured, may be employed with safety, and exposed
to the open air even.</p>

CHAP. 51.‚ÄîTHE VARIOUS METHODS OF BUILDING.</span></h3></div>

<p>The Greeks construct party-walls, resembling those of brickwork,
of hard stone or of silex, squared. This kind of stonework
is what they call ‚Äúisodomon,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2789_2789"></a><a href="#Footnote_2789_2789" class="fnanchor">2789</a> it being ‚Äù pseudisodomon‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2790_2790"></a><a href="#Footnote_2790_2790" class="fnanchor">2790</a>
when the wall is built of materials of unequal dimensions.
A third kind of stonework is called ‚Äúemplecton,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2791_2791"></a><a href="#Footnote_2791_2791" class="fnanchor">2791</a> the two
exteriors only being made with regularity, the rest of the
material being thrown in at random. It is necessary that
the stones should lie over one another alternately, in such a
way that the middle of one stone meets the point of junction
of the two below it; and this, too, in the middle of the wall,
if possible; but if not, at all events, at the sides. When the
middle of the wall is filled up with broken stones, the work
is known as ‚Äúdiatoichon.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2792_2792"></a><a href="#Footnote_2792_2792" class="fnanchor">2792</a></p>

<p>Cisterns should be made of five parts of pure, gravelly, sand,
two of the very strongest quicklime, and fragments of silex
not exceeding a pound each in weight; when thus incorporated,
the bottom and sides should be well beaten with iron
rammers. The best plan, too, is to have the cisterns double;

of various colours: that made of white stone is the best.
Lime prepared from hard stone is the best for building purposes,
and that from porous stone for coats of plaster. For
both these purposes, lime made from silex is equally rejected.
Stone that has been extracted from quarries furnishes a better
lime than that collected from the beds of rivers; but the best of
all is the lime that is obtained from the molar-stone,<a id="FNanchor_2796_2796"></a><a href="#Footnote_2796_2796" class="fnanchor">2796</a> that being
of a more unctuous nature than the others. It is something

CHAP. 55.‚ÄîDEFECTS IN BUILDING. PLASTERS FOR WALLS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The great cause of the fall of so many buildings in our City, is,
that through a fraudulent abstraction of the lime, the rough
work is laid without anything to hold it together. The
older, too, the mortar is, the better it is in quality. In the
ancient laws for the regulation of building, no contractor was
to use mortar less than three months old; hence it is, that no
cracks have disfigured the plaster coatings of their walls.
These stuccos will never present a sufficiently bright surface,
unless there have been three layers of sanded mortar, and two
of marbled<a id="FNanchor_2799_2799"></a><a href="#Footnote_2799_2799" class="fnanchor">2799</a> mortar upon that. In damp localities and places
subject to exhalations from the sea, it is the best plan to substitute
ground earthenware mortar for sanded mortar. In
Greece, it is the practice, first to pound the lime and sand used
for plastering, with wooden pestles in a large trough. The test
by which it is known that marbled mortar has been properly
blended, is its not adhering to the trowel; whereas, if it is
only wanted for white-washing, the lime, after being well
slaked with water, should stick like glue. For this last
purpose, however, the lime should only be slaked in lumps.</p>

<p>At Elis, there is a Temple of Minerva, which was pargetted,
they say, by Pan√¶nus, the brother of Phidias, with a mortar
that was blended with milk and saffron:<a id="FNanchor_2800_2800"></a><a href="#Footnote_2800_2800" class="fnanchor">2800</a> hence it is, that,
even at the present day, when rubbed with spittle on the
finger, it yields the smell and flavour of saffron.</p>

CHAP. 56.‚ÄîCOLUMNS. THE SEVERAL KINDS OF COLUMNS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The more closely columns are placed together, the thicker
they appear to be. There are four different kinds of pillars.
Those of which the diameter at the foot is one-sixth part
of the height, are called Doric. When the diameter is one-ninth,
they are Ionic; and when it is one-seventh, Tuscan.
The proportions in the Corinthian are the same as those of
the Ionic; but they differ in the circumstance that the
Corinthian capitals are of the same height as the diameter
at the foot, a thing that gives them a more slender appearance;
whereas, in the Ionic column, the height of the
capital is only one-third of the diameter at the foot. In
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span>ancient times the rule was, that the columns should be one-third
of the breadth of the temple in height.</p>

<p>It was in the Temple of Diana, at Ephesus, as originally
built, that spirals<a id="FNanchor_2801_2801"></a><a href="#Footnote_2801_2801" class="fnanchor">2801</a> were first placed beneath, and capitals
added: and it was determined that the diameter of the shafts
should be one-eighth of their height, and that the spirals
should be one-half of the diameter in height, the upper extremity
of the shaft being one-seventh less in diameter than
the foot. In addition to these columns, there are what are
called ‚ÄúAttic‚Äù columns, quadrangular, and with equal sides.</p>

<p>Lime is also employed very extensively in medicine. For
this purpose, fresh lime is selected, which has not been slaked
with water. Its properties are caustic, resolvent, and attractive;
and it prevents serpiginous ulcers from spreading, being
incorporated with vinegar and oil of roses, for the purpose.
When this has been effected, it is tempered with wax and oil of
roses, and applied to promote cicatrization. In combination
with honey, and liquid resin, or hogs‚Äô lard, lime is curative of
sprains and scrofulous sores.</p>

<p>Gypsum<a id="FNanchor_2804_2804"></a><a href="#Footnote_2804_2804" class="fnanchor">2804</a> has a close affinity with limestone, and there are
numerous varieties of it. One kind is prepared from a calcined<a id="FNanchor_2805_2805"></a><a href="#Footnote_2805_2805" class="fnanchor">2805</a>
stone, as in Syria, and at Thurii, for example. In
Cyprus and at Perrh√¶bia,<a id="FNanchor_2806_2806"></a><a href="#Footnote_2806_2806" class="fnanchor">2806</a> gypsum is dug out of the earth,
and at Tymph√¶a<a id="FNanchor_2807_2807"></a><a href="#Footnote_2807_2807" class="fnanchor">2807</a> it is found just below the level of the soil.
The stone that is calcined for this purpose, ought to be very
similar to alabastrites,<a id="FNanchor_2808_2808"></a><a href="#Footnote_2808_2808" class="fnanchor">2808</a> or else of a grain like that of marble.
In Syria, they select the hardest stones for the purpose, and
calcine them with cow-dung, to accelerate the process. Experience
has proved, however, that the best plaster of all is
that prepared from specular-stone,<a id="FNanchor_2809_2809"></a><a href="#Footnote_2809_2809" class="fnanchor">2809</a> or any other stone that is
similarly laminated. Gypsum, when moistened, must be used
immediately, as it hardens with the greatest rapidity; it
admits, however, of being triturated over again, and so reduced
to powder. It is very useful for pargetting, and has a
pleasing effect when used for ornamental figures and wreaths
in buildings.</p>

<p>There is one remarkable fact connected with this substance;
Caius Proculeius,<a id="FNanchor_2810_2810"></a><a href="#Footnote_2810_2810" class="fnanchor">2810</a> an intimate friend of the Emperor Augustus,
suffering from violent pains in the stomach, swallowed gypsum,

<p>The first pavements, in my opinion, were those now known

that was beaten down with the rammer: at least if we may
form a judgment from the name<a id="FNanchor_2816_2816"></a><a href="#Footnote_2816_2816" class="fnanchor">2816</a> that has been given to them.
The first diamonded<a id="FNanchor_2817_2817"></a><a href="#Footnote_2817_2817" class="fnanchor">2817</a> pavement at Rome was laid in the Temple
of Jupiter Capitolinus, after the commencement of the Third
Punic War. That pavements had come into common use before
the Cimbric War, and that a taste for them was very
prevalent, is evident from the line of Lucilius‚Äî</p>

<p>The Greeks have also invented terrace-roof<a id="FNanchor_2819_2819"></a><a href="#Footnote_2819_2819" class="fnanchor">2819</a> pavements, and
have covered their houses with them; a thing that may easily be
done in the hotter climates, but a great mistake in countries
where the rain is apt to become congealed. In making these
pavements, the proper plan is to begin with two layers of boards,
running different ways, and nailed at the extremities, to prevent
them from warping. Upon this planking a rough-work must
be laid, one-fourth of which consists of pounded pottery: and
upon this, another bed of rough-work, two-fifths composed of
lime, a foot in thickness, and well beaten down with the
rammer. The nucleus<a id="FNanchor_2820_2820"></a><a href="#Footnote_2820_2820" class="fnanchor">2820</a> is then laid down, a bed six fingers
in depth; and upon that, large square stones, not less than a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">378</a></span>couple of fingers in thickness; an inclination being carefully
observed, of an inch and a half to every ten feet. This done,
the surface is well rubbed down with a polishing stone. The
general opinion is, that oak<a id="FNanchor_2821_2821"></a><a href="#Footnote_2821_2821" class="fnanchor">2821</a> should never be used for the
planking, it being so very liable to warp; and it is considered
a good plan to cover the boards with a layer of fern or chaff,
that they may be the better able to resist the action of the
lime. It is necessary, too, before putting down the planking,
to underset it with a bed of round pebbles. Wheat-ear<a id="FNanchor_2822_2822"></a><a href="#Footnote_2822_2822" class="fnanchor">2822</a> tesselated
pavements are laid down in a similar manner.</p>

<p>We must not omit here one other kind of pavement, that

and a bed of rough work, or else broken pottery, is then laid
upon it. Upon the top of this, a layer of charcoal is placed,
well trodden down with a mixture of sand, lime, and ashes; care
being taken, by line and rule, to give it a uniform thickness
of half a foot. The surface then presents the ordinary appearance
of the ground; but if it is well rubbed with the
polishing-stone, it will have all the appearance of a black
pavement.</p>

<p>Mosaic<a id="FNanchor_2823_2823"></a><a href="#Footnote_2823_2823" class="fnanchor">2823</a> pavements were first introduced in the time of
Sylla; at all events, there is still in existence a pavement,
formed of small segments, which he ordered to be laid down
in the Temple of Fortune, at Pr√¶neste. Since his time, these
mosaics have left the ground for the arched roofs of houses,
and they are now made of glass. This, however, is but a
recent invention; for there can be no doubt that, when Agrippa
ordered the earthenware walls of the hot baths, in the
Therm√¶ which he was building at Rome, to be painted in
encaustic, and had the other parts coated with pargetting, he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">379</a></span>would have had the arches decorated with mosaics in glass, if
the use of them had been known; or, at all events, if from the
walls of the Theatre of Scaurus, where it figured, as already<a id="FNanchor_2824_2824"></a><a href="#Footnote_2824_2824" class="fnanchor">2824</a>
stated, glass had by that time come to be used for the arched
roofs of apartments. It will be as well, therefore, to give
some account, also, of glass.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_65"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 65. (26.)‚ÄîTHE ORIGIN OF GLASS.</span></h3></div>

<p>In Syria there is a region known as Ph≈ìnice,<a id="FNanchor_2825_2825"></a><a href="#Footnote_2825_2825" class="fnanchor">2825</a> adjoining to
Jud√¶a, and enclosing, between the lower ridges of Mount
Carmelus, a marshy district known by the name of Cendebia.
In this district, it is supposed, rises the river Belus,<a id="FNanchor_2826_2826"></a><a href="#Footnote_2826_2826" class="fnanchor">2826</a> which,
after a course of five miles, empties itself into the sea near the
colony of Ptolema√Øs. The tide of this river is sluggish, and
the water unwholesome to drink, but held sacred for the
observance of certain religious ceremonials. Full of slimy
deposits, and very deep, it is only at the reflux of the tide
that the river discloses its sands; which, agitated by the
waves, separate themselves from their impurities, and so
become cleansed. It is generally thought that it is the
acridity of the sea-water that has this purgative effect upon
the sand, and that without this action no use could be made
of it. The shore upon which this sand is gathered is not
more than half a mile in extent; and yet, for many ages, this
was the only spot that afforded the material for making glass.</p>

<p>The story is, that a ship, laden with nitre,<a id="FNanchor_2827_2827"></a><a href="#Footnote_2827_2827" class="fnanchor">2827</a> being moored
upon this spot, the merchants, while preparing their repast
upon the sea-shore, finding no stones at hand for supporting
their cauldrons, employed for the purpose some lumps of nitre
which they had taken from the vessel. Upon its being subjected
to the action of the fire, in combination with the sand
of the sea-shore, they beheld transparent streams flowing forth
of a liquid hitherto unknown: this, it is said, was the origin
of glass.<a id="FNanchor_2828_2828"></a><a href="#Footnote_2828_2828" class="fnanchor">2828</a></p>

CHAP. 66.‚ÄîTHE VARIOUS KINDS OF GLASS, AND THE MODE OF
MAKING IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>In process of time, as human industry is ingenious in discovering,
it was not content with the combination of nitre,
but magnet-stone<a id="FNanchor_2829_2829"></a><a href="#Footnote_2829_2829" class="fnanchor">2829</a> began to be added as well; from the impression
that it attracts liquefied<a id="FNanchor_2830_2830"></a><a href="#Footnote_2830_2830" class="fnanchor">2830</a> glass as well as iron. In a
similar manner, too, brilliant stones of various descriptions
came to be added in the melting, and, at last, shells and fossil
sand. Some authors tell us, that the glass of India is made of
broken crystal, and that, in consequence, there is none that
can be compared to it.</p>

<p>In fusing it, light and dry wood is used for fuel, Cyprian
copper and nitre being added to the melting, nitre of Ophir<a id="FNanchor_2831_2831"></a><a href="#Footnote_2831_2831" class="fnanchor">2831</a>
more particularly. It is melted, like copper, in contiguous
furnaces, and a swarthy mass of an unctuous appearance is the
result. Of such a penetrating nature is the molten glass, that
it will cut to the very bone any part of the body which ‚Äúit
may come near, and that, too, before it is even felt. This
mass is again subjected to fusion in the furnace, for the purpose
of colouring it; after which, the glass is either blown
into various forms, turned in a lathe, or engraved<a id="FNanchor_2832_2832"></a><a href="#Footnote_2832_2832" class="fnanchor">2832</a> like silver.
Sidon was formerly famous for its glass-houses, for it was this
place that first invented<a id="FNanchor_2833_2833"></a><a href="#Footnote_2833_2833" class="fnanchor">2833</a> mirrors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">381</a></span>Such was the ancient method of making glass: but, at the
present day, there is found a very white sand for the purpose,
at the mouth of the river Volturnus, in Italy. It spreads
over an extent of six miles, upon the sea-shore that lies
between Cum√¶ and Liternum, and is prepared for use by
pounding it with a pestle and mortar; which done, it is mixed
with three parts of nitre, either by weight or measure, and,
when fused, is transferred to another furnace. Here it forms
a mass of what is called ‚Äúhammonitrum;‚Äù which is again
submitted to fusion, and becomes a mass of pure, white, glass.
Indeed, at the present day, throughout the Gallic and Spanish
provinces even, we find sand subjected to a similar process.
In the reign of Tiberius, it is said, a combination was devised
which produced a flexible<a id="FNanchor_2834_2834"></a><a href="#Footnote_2834_2834" class="fnanchor">2834</a> glass; but the manufactory of the
artist was totally destroyed, we are told, in order to prevent the

This story, however, was, for a long time, more widely spread
than well authenticated. But be it as it may, it is of little
consequence; for, in the time of the Emperor Nero, there was a
process discovered, by which two small glass cups were made,
of the kind called ‚Äúpetroti,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2836_2836"></a><a href="#Footnote_2836_2836" class="fnanchor">2836</a> the price of which was no less
than six thousand sesterces!</p>

CHAP. 67.‚ÄîOBSIAN GLASS AND OBSIAN STONE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Among the various kinds of glass, we may also reckon
Obsian glass, a substance very similar to the stone<a id="FNanchor_2837_2837"></a><a href="#Footnote_2837_2837" class="fnanchor">2837</a> which
Obsius discovered in √Üthiopia. This stone is of a very dark
colour, and sometimes transparent; but it is dull to the sight,
and reflects, when attached as a mirror to walls, the shadow
of the object rather than the image. Many persons use it<a id="FNanchor_2838_2838"></a><a href="#Footnote_2838_2838" class="fnanchor">2838</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">382</a></span>for jewellery, and I myself have seen solid statues<a id="FNanchor_2839_2839"></a><a href="#Footnote_2839_2839" class="fnanchor">2839</a> in this
material of the late Emperor Augustus, of very considerable
thickness. That prince consecrated, in the Temple of Concord,
as something marvellous, four figures of elephants made
of Obsian stone. Tiberius C√¶sar, too, restored to the people
of Heliopolis, as an object of ceremonial worship, an image in
this stone, which had been found among the property left by
one of the pr√¶fects of Egypt. It was a figure of Menela√ºs; a
circumstance which goes far towards proving that the use of
this material is of more ancient date than is generally supposed,
confounded as it is at the present day with glass, by
reason of its resemblance. Xenocrates says that Obsian stone
is found in India also, and in Samnium in Italy; and that it
is a natural product of Spain, upon the coasts which border
on the Ocean.<a id="FNanchor_2840_2840"></a><a href="#Footnote_2840_2840" class="fnanchor">2840</a></p>

<p>There is an artificial Obsian stone, made of coloured glass
for services for the table; and there is also a glass that is red
all through, and opaque, known as ‚Äúh√¶matinum.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2841_2841"></a><a href="#Footnote_2841_2841" class="fnanchor">2841</a> A dead
white glass, too, is made, as also other kinds in imitation of murrhine<a id="FNanchor_2842_2842"></a><a href="#Footnote_2842_2842" class="fnanchor">2842</a>
colour, hyacinthine, sapphire, and every other tint:
indeed, there is no material of a more pliable<a id="FNanchor_2843_2843"></a><a href="#Footnote_2843_2843" class="fnanchor">2843</a> nature than
this, or better suited for colouring. Still, however, the
highest value is set upon glass that is entirely colourless and
transparent, as nearly as possible resembling crystal, in fact.
For drinking-vessels, glass has quite superseded the use of
silver and gold; but it is unable to stand heat unless a
cold liquid is poured in first. And yet, we find that globular
glass vessels, filled with water, when brought in contact with
the rays of the sun,<a id="FNanchor_2844_2844"></a><a href="#Footnote_2844_2844" class="fnanchor">2844</a> become heated to such a degree as to
cause articles of clothing to ignite. When broken, too, glass
admits of being joined by the agency of heat; but it cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">383</a></span>be wholly fused without being pulverized into small fragments,<a id="FNanchor_2845_2845"></a><a href="#Footnote_2845_2845" class="fnanchor">2845</a>
as we see done in the process of making the small
checquers, known as ‚Äúabaculi,‚Äù for mosaic work; some of
which are of variegated colours, and of different shapes. If
glass is fused with sulphur, it will become as hard as stone.</p>

CHAP. 68. (27.)‚ÄîMARVELLOUS FACTS CONNECTED WITH FIRE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Having now described all the creations of human ingenuity,
reproductions, in fact, of Nature by the agency of art, it
cannot but recur to us, with a feeling of admiration, that there
is hardly any process which is not perfected through the
intervention of fire. Submit to its action some sandy soil,
and in one place it will yield glass, in another silver, in
another minium, and in others, again, lead and its several
varieties, pigments, and numerous medicaments. It is through
the agency of fire that stones<a id="FNanchor_2846_2846"></a><a href="#Footnote_2846_2846" class="fnanchor">2846</a> are melted into copper; by fire
that iron is produced, and subdued to our purposes; by fire
that gold is purified; by fire, too, that the stone is calcined,
which is to hold together the walls of our houses.</p>

<p>Some materials, again, are all the better for being repeatedly
submitted to the action of fire; and the same substance will
yield one product at the first fusion, another at the second, and
another at the third.<a id="FNanchor_2847_2847"></a><a href="#Footnote_2847_2847" class="fnanchor">2847</a> Charcoal, when it has passed through fire
and has been quenched, only begins to assume its active properties;
and, when it might be supposed to have been reduced
to annihilation, it is then that it has its greatest energies. An
element this, of immense, of boundless<a id="FNanchor_2848_2848"></a><a href="#Footnote_2848_2848" class="fnanchor">2848</a> power, and, as to
which, it is a matter of doubt whether it does not create even
more than it destroys!</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_69"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 69.‚ÄîTHREE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM FIRE AND FROM
ASHES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Fire even has certain medicinal virtues of its own. When
pestilences prevail, in consequence of the obscuration<a id="FNanchor_2849_2849"></a><a href="#Footnote_2849_2849" class="fnanchor">2849</a> of the
sun, it is a well-known fact, that if fires are lighted, they are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">384</a></span>productive of beneficial results in numerous ways. Empedocles
and Hippocrates have proved this in several passages.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor convulsions or contusions of the viscera,‚Äù says M.
Varro‚Äîfor it is his own words that I use‚Äî‚Äúlet the hearth be
your medicine-box; for lie of ashes,<a id="FNanchor_2850_2850"></a><a href="#Footnote_2850_2850" class="fnanchor">2850</a> taken from thence, mixed
with your drink, will effect a cure. Witness the gladiators, for
example, who, when disabled at the Games, refresh themselves
with this drink.‚Äù Carbuncle too, a kind of disease which, as
already<a id="FNanchor_2851_2851"></a><a href="#Footnote_2851_2851" class="fnanchor">2851</a> stated, has recently carried off two persons of consular
rank, admits of being successfully treated with oak-charcoal,<a id="FNanchor_2852_2852"></a><a href="#Footnote_2852_2852" class="fnanchor">2852</a>
triturated with honey. So true is it that things which are despised
even, and looked upon as so utterly destitute of all virtues,
have still their own remedial properties, charcoal and ashes for
example.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVI_CHAP_70"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 70.‚ÄîPRODIGIES CONNECTED WITH THE HEARTH.</span></h3></div>

<p>I must not omit too, one portentous fact connected with the
hearth, and famous in Roman history. In the reign of Tarquinius
Priscus, it is said, there appeared upon his hearth a resemblance
of the male generative organ in the midst of the
ashes. The captive Ocrisia, a servant of Queen Tanaquil, who
happened to be sitting there, arose from her seat in a state of
pregnancy, and became the mother of Servius Tullius, who eventually
succeeded to the throne.<a id="FNanchor_2853_2853"></a><a href="#Footnote_2853_2853" class="fnanchor">2853</a> It is stated, too, that while the
child was sleeping in the palace, a flame was seen playing
round his head; the consequence of which was, that it was
believed that the Lar of the household was his progenitor. It
was owing to this circumstance, we are informed, that the
Compitalia,<a id="FNanchor_2854_2854"></a><a href="#Footnote_2854_2854" class="fnanchor">2854</a> games in honour of the Lares, were instituted.</p>

<h3 class="section nobreak" id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_1"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 1. (1.)‚ÄîTHE FIRST USE OF PRECIOUS STONES.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">That</span> nothing may be wanting to the work which I have
undertaken, it still remains for me to speak of precious stones:
a subject in which the majestic might of Nature presents itself
to us, contracted within a very limited space, though, in the
opinion of many, nowhere displayed in a more admirable form.
So great is the value that men attach to the multiplied varieties
of these gems, their numerous colours, their constituent parts,
and their singular beauty, that, in the case of some of them, it
is looked upon as no less than sacrilege to engrave them, for
signets even, the very purpose for which, in reality, they were
made. Others, again, are regarded as beyond all price, and could
not be valued at any known amount of human wealth; so much
so that, in the case of many, it is quite sufficient to have some
single gem or other before the eyes, there to behold the supreme
and absolute perfection of Nature‚Äôs work.</p>

<p>We have already<a id="FNanchor_2889_2889"></a><a href="#Footnote_2889_2889" class="fnanchor">2889</a> stated, to some extent, when speaking on
the subject of gold and rings, how the use of precious stones
first originated, and from what beginnings this admiration of
them has now increased to such an universal passion. According
to fabulous lore, the first use of them was suggested
by the rocks of Caucasus, in consequence of an unhappy interpretation
which was given to the story of the chains of Prometheus:
for we are told by tradition, that he enclosed a fragment
of this stone in iron, and wore it upon his finger;<a id="FNanchor_2890_2890"></a><a href="#Footnote_2890_2890" class="fnanchor">2890</a> such
being the first ring and the first jewel known.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_2"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 2.‚ÄîTHE JEWEL OF POLYCRATES.</span></h3></div>

<p>With a beginning such as this, the value set upon precious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">387</a></span>stones increased to such a boundless extent, that Polycrates,<a id="FNanchor_2891_2891"></a><a href="#Footnote_2891_2891" class="fnanchor">2891</a>
the tyrant of Samos, who ruled over the islands and the adjacent
shores, when he admitted that his good fortune had been
too great, deemed it a sufficient expiation for all this enjoyment
of happiness, to make a voluntary sacrifice of a single
precious stone; thinking thereby to balance accounts with the
inconstancy of fortune, and, by this single cause for regret,
abundantly to buy off every ill-will she might entertain.
Weary, therefore, of his continued prosperity, he embarked on
board a ship, and, putting out to sea, threw the ring which he
wore into the waves. It so happened, however, that a fish of remarkable
size, one destined for the table of a king, swallowed
the jewel, as it would have done a bait; and then, to complete
the portentous omen, restored it again to the owner in the
royal kitchen, by the ruling hand of a treacherous<a id="FNanchor_2892_2892"></a><a href="#Footnote_2892_2892" class="fnanchor">2892</a> fortune.</p>

<p>The stone in this ring, it is generally agreed, was a sardonyx,<a id="FNanchor_2893_2893"></a><a href="#Footnote_2893_2893" class="fnanchor">2893</a>
and they still show one at Rome, which, if we believe the
story, was this identical stone. It is enclosed in a horn of gold,
and was deposited, by the Emperor Augustus, in the Temple
of Concord, where it holds pretty nearly the lowest rank among
a multitude of other jewels that are preferable to it.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_3"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 3.‚ÄîTHE JEWEL OF PYRRHUS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Next in note after this ring, is the jewel that belonged to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">388</a></span>another king, Pyrrhus, who was so long at war with the Romans.
It is said that there was in his possession an agate,<a id="FNanchor_2894_2894"></a><a href="#Footnote_2894_2894" class="fnanchor">2894</a> upon which
were to be seen the Nine Muses and Apollo holding a lyre; not
a work of art, but the spontaneous produce of Nature,<a id="FNanchor_2895_2895"></a><a href="#Footnote_2895_2895" class="fnanchor">2895</a> the veins
in it being so arranged that each of the Muses had her own
peculiar attribute.</p>

<p>With the exception of these two jewels, authors make no
mention of any others that have been rendered famous. We
only find it recorded by them, that Ismenias the flute-player<a id="FNanchor_2896_2896"></a><a href="#Footnote_2896_2896" class="fnanchor">2896</a>
was in the habit of displaying great numbers of glittering
stones, a piece of vanity, on his part, which gave occasion to
the following story. An emerald,<a id="FNanchor_2897_2897"></a><a href="#Footnote_2897_2897" class="fnanchor">2897</a> upon which was engraved
a figure of Amymone,<a id="FNanchor_2898_2898"></a><a href="#Footnote_2898_2898" class="fnanchor">2898</a> being offered for sale in the Isle of
Cyprus at the price of six golden denarii, he gave orders to
purchase it. The dealer however, reduced the price, and
returned two denarii; upon which, Ismenias remarked‚Äî‚ÄúBy
Hercules! he has done me but a bad turn in this, for the merit
of the stone has been greatly impaired by this reduction in
price.‚Äù</p>

<p>It seems to have been this Ismenias who introduced the
universal practice among musicians of proclaiming their artistic
merit by this kind of ostentation. Thus Dionysodorus, for
instance, his contemporary and rival, imitated his example,
in order that he might not appear to be his inferior in skill;
whereas, in reality, he only held the third rank among the
musicians of that day. Nicomachus, too, it is said, was the
possessor of great numbers of precious stones, though selected
with but little taste. In mentioning these illustrations, by way
of prelude to this Book, it is by no means improbable that they
may have the appearance of being addressed to those, who,
piquing themselves upon a similar display, become puffed up
with a vanity which is evidently much more appropriate to a
performer on the flute.</p>

<p>The stone of the ring<a id="FNanchor_2899_2899"></a><a href="#Footnote_2899_2899" class="fnanchor">2899</a> which is now shown as that of Polycrates,
is untouched and without engraving. In the time of
Ismenias, long<a id="FNanchor_2900_2900"></a><a href="#Footnote_2900_2900" class="fnanchor">2900</a> after his day, it would appear to have become
the practice to engrave smaragdi even; a fact which is established
by an edict of Alexander the Great, forbidding his portrait
to be cut upon this stone by any other engraver than
Pyrgoteles,<a id="FNanchor_2901_2901"></a><a href="#Footnote_2901_2901" class="fnanchor">2901</a> who, no doubt, was the most famous adept in this
art. Since his time, Apollonides and Cronius have excelled in
it; as also Dioscurides,<a id="FNanchor_2902_2902"></a><a href="#Footnote_2902_2902" class="fnanchor">2902</a> who engraved a very excellent likeness
of the late Emperor Augustus upon a signet, which, ever since,
the Roman emperors have used. The Dictator Sylla, it is
said, always made use of a seal<a id="FNanchor_2903_2903"></a><a href="#Footnote_2903_2903" class="fnanchor">2903</a> which represented the surrender
of Jugurtha. Authors inform us also, that the native
of Intercatia,<a id="FNanchor_2904_2904"></a><a href="#Footnote_2904_2904" class="fnanchor">2904</a> whose father challenged Scipio √Ümilianus,<a id="FNanchor_2905_2905"></a><a href="#Footnote_2905_2905" class="fnanchor">2905</a>
and was slain by him, was in the habit of using a signet
with a representation of this combat engraved upon it; a circumstance
which gave rise to the well-known joke of Stilo
Pr√¶coninus,<a id="FNanchor_2906_2906"></a><a href="#Footnote_2906_2906" class="fnanchor">2906</a> who naively enquired, what he would have done
if Scipio had been the person slain?</p>

<p>The late Emperor Augustus was in the habit, at first, of
using the figure of a Sphinx<a id="FNanchor_2907_2907"></a><a href="#Footnote_2907_2907" class="fnanchor">2907</a> for his signet; having found
two of them, among the jewels of his mother, that were perfectly
alike. During the Civil Wars, his friends used to employ
one of these signets, in his absence, for sealing such letters
and edicts as the circumstances of the times required to be
issued in his name; it being far from an unmeaning pleasantry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">390</a></span>on the part of those who received these missives, that the
Sphinx always brought its enigmas<a id="FNanchor_2908_2908"></a><a href="#Footnote_2908_2908" class="fnanchor">2908</a> with it. The frog, too,
on the seal of M√¶cenas, was held in great terror, by reason of
the monetary imposts which it announced. At a later period,
with the view of avoiding the sarcasms relative to the Sphinx,
Augustus made use of a signet with a figure upon it of Alexander
the Great.</p>

there was no other such collection there, until at length Pompeius
Magnus consecrated in the Capitol, among other donations,
one that had belonged to King Mithridates; and which,
as M. Varro and other authors of that period assure us, was
greatly superior to that of Scaurus. Following his example,
the Dictator C√¶sar consecrated six dactyliothec√¶ in the Temple
of Venus Genetrix; and Marcellus, the son of Octavia,<a id="FNanchor_2911_2911"></a><a href="#Footnote_2911_2911" class="fnanchor">2911</a> presented

just as the victories, gained by L. Scipio<a id="FNanchor_2912_2912"></a><a href="#Footnote_2912_2912" class="fnanchor">2912</a> and Cneius Manlius,<a id="FNanchor_2913_2913"></a><a href="#Footnote_2913_2913" class="fnanchor">2913</a>
had first turned the public attention to chased silver,
Attalic tissues, and banquetting-couches decorated with bronze;
and the conquests of L. Mummius had brought Corinthian
bronzes and pictures into notice.</p>

<p>(2.) To prove more fully that this was the case, I will here
give the very words of the public Registers<a id="FNanchor_2914_2914"></a><a href="#Footnote_2914_2914" class="fnanchor">2914</a> with reference
to the triumphs of Pompeius Magnus. On the occasion of his
third triumph, over the Pirates and over the Kings and nations
of Asia and Pontus that have been already enumerated in the
Seventh Book<a id="FNanchor_2915_2915"></a><a href="#Footnote_2915_2915" class="fnanchor">2915</a> of this work, M. Fiso and M. Messala being
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">391</a></span>consuls,<a id="FNanchor_2916_2916"></a><a href="#Footnote_2916_2916" class="fnanchor">2916</a> on the day before<a id="FNanchor_2917_2917"></a><a href="#Footnote_2917_2917" class="fnanchor">2917</a> the calends of October, the anniversary
of his birth, he displayed in public, with its pieces,
a chess-board,<a id="FNanchor_2918_2918"></a><a href="#Footnote_2918_2918" class="fnanchor">2918</a> made of two precious stones, three feet in
width by two in length‚Äîand to leave no doubt that the resources
of Nature do become exhausted, I will here observe,
that no precious stones are to be found at the present day, at all
approaching such dimensions as these; as also that there was
upon this board a moon of solid gold, thirty pounds in weight!‚Äîthree
banquetting-couches; vessels for nine waiters, in
gold and precious stones; three golden statues of Minerva,
Mars, and Apollo; thirty-three crowns adorned with pearls;
a square mountain of gold, with stags upon it, lions, and all
kinds of fruit, and surrounded with a vine of gold; as also a
mus√¶um,<a id="FNanchor_2919_2919"></a><a href="#Footnote_2919_2919" class="fnanchor">2919</a> adorned with pearls, with an horologe<a id="FNanchor_2920_2920"></a><a href="#Footnote_2920_2920" class="fnanchor">2920</a> upon the
top of it.</p>

<p>There was a likeness also in pearls of Pompeius himself, his
noble countenance, with the hair thrown back from the forehead,
delighting the eye. Yes, I say, those frank features, so
venerated throughout all nations, were here displayed in pearls!
the severity of our ancient manners being thus subdued, and
the display being more the triumph of luxury than the triumph
of conquest. Never, most assuredly, would Pompeius have so
long maintained his surname of ‚ÄúMagnus‚Äù among the men of
that day, if on the occasion of his first<a id="FNanchor_2921_2921"></a><a href="#Footnote_2921_2921" class="fnanchor">2921</a> conquest his triumph
had been such as this. Thy portrait in pearls, O Magnus! those
resources of prodigality, that have been discovered for the
sake of females only! Thy portrait in pearls, refinements in
luxury, which the Roman laws would not have allowed thee to
wear even! And was it in this way that thy value must be appreciated?
Would not that trophy have given a more truthful likeness
of thee which thou hadst erst erected upon the Pyren√¶an<a id="FNanchor_2922_2922"></a><a href="#Footnote_2922_2922" class="fnanchor">2922</a>
mountain heights? Assuredly such a portrait as this had been
no less than a downright ignominy and disgrace, were we not
bound to behold in it a menacing presage of the anger of the
gods, and to see foreshadowed thereby the time when that head,
now laden with the wealth of the East, was to be displayed,
severed from the body.<a id="FNanchor_2923_2923"></a><a href="#Footnote_2923_2923" class="fnanchor">2923</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">392</a></span>But in other respects, how truly befitting the hero was this
triumph! To the state, he presented two thousand millions of
sesterces; to the legati and qu√¶stors who had exerted themselves
in defence of the sea coast, he gave one thousand millions
of sesterces; and to each individual soldier, six thousand sesterces.
He has rendered, however, comparatively excusable
the Emperor Caius,<a id="FNanchor_2924_2924"></a><a href="#Footnote_2924_2924" class="fnanchor">2924</a> who, in addition to other feminine luxuries,
used to wear shoes adorned with pearls; as also the
Emperor Nero, who used to adorn his sceptres with masks
worked in pearls, and had the couches, destined for his pleasures,
made of the same costly materials. Nay, we have no longer any
right, it would seem, to censure the employment of drinking-cups
adorned with precious stones, of various other articles in
daily use that are similarly enriched, and of rings that sparkle
with gems: for what species of luxury can there be thought of,
that was not more innocent in its results than this on the part of
Pompeius?</p>

CHAP. 7.‚ÄîAT WHAT PERIOD MURRHINE VESSELS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED
AT ROME. INSTANCES OF LUXURY IN REFERENCE TO
THEM.</span></h3></div>

<p>It was the same conquest, too, that first introduced murrhine<a id="FNanchor_2925_2925"></a><a href="#Footnote_2925_2925" class="fnanchor">2925</a>
vessels at Rome; Pompeius being the first to dedicate, at
the conclusion of this triumph, vases and cups, made of this
material, in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus: a circumstance
which soon brought them into private use, waiters, even, and
eating-utensils made of murrhine being in great request.
This species of luxury, too, is daily on the increase, a single
cup, which would hold no more than three sextarii, having
been purchased at the price of seventy thousand sesterces. A.
person of consular rank, who some years<a id="FNanchor_2926_2926"></a><a href="#Footnote_2926_2926" class="fnanchor">2926</a> ago used to drink
out of this cup, grew so passionately fond of it, as to gnaw its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">393</a></span>edges even, an injury, however, which has only tended to enhance
its value: indeed there is now no vessel in murrhine that
has ever been estimated at a higher figure than this. We
may form some opinion how much money this same personage
swallowed up in articles of this description, from the fact that
the number of them was so great, that, when the Emperor
Nero deprived his children of them, and they were exposed to
public view, they occupied a whole theatre to themselves, in
the gardens beyond the Tiber; a theatre which was found
sufficiently large even, for the audience that attended on the
occasion when Nero<a id="FNanchor_2927_2927"></a><a href="#Footnote_2927_2927" class="fnanchor">2927</a> rehearsed his musical performances before
his appearance in the Theatre of Pompeius. It was at this
exhibition, too, that I saw counted the broken fragments of a
single cup, which it was thought proper to preserve in an urn
and display, I suppose, with the view of exciting the sorrows
of the world, and of exposing the cruelty of fortune; just as
though it had been no less than the body of Alexander the
Great himself!</p>

<p>T. Petronius,<a id="FNanchor_2928_2928"></a><a href="#Footnote_2928_2928" class="fnanchor">2928</a> a personage of consular rank, intending, from
his hatred of Nero, to disinherit the table of that prince, broke
a murrhine basin, which had cost him no less than three
hundred thousand sesterces. But Nero himself, as it was only
proper for a prince to do, surpassed them all, by paying one
million of sesterces for a single cup: a fact well worthy of
remembrance, that an emperor, the father of his country,
should have drunk from a vessel of such costly price!</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_8"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 8.‚ÄîTHE NATURE OF MURRHINE VESSELS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Murrhine vessels come from the East, in numerous localities
of which, remarkable for nothing else, they are to be found.
It is in the empire of the Parthians, more particularly, that
they are met with, though those of the very finest quality
come to us from Carmania.<a id="FNanchor_2929_2929"></a><a href="#Footnote_2929_2929" class="fnanchor">2929</a> It is generally thought that
these vessels are formed of a moist substance, which under
ground becomes solidified by heat.<a id="FNanchor_2930_2930"></a><a href="#Footnote_2930_2930" class="fnanchor">2930</a> In size they never exceed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">394</a></span>a small waiter,<a id="FNanchor_2931_2931"></a><a href="#Footnote_2931_2931" class="fnanchor">2931</a> and, as to thickness, they rarely admit of
being used as drinking-cups, so large as those already<a id="FNanchor_2932_2932"></a><a href="#Footnote_2932_2932" class="fnanchor">2932</a> mentioned.
The brightness of them is destitute of strength, and
it may be said that they are rather shining than brilliant.<a id="FNanchor_2933_2933"></a><a href="#Footnote_2933_2933" class="fnanchor">2933</a>
But the chief merit of them is the great variety of their
colours, and the wreathed veins, which, every here and there,
present shades of purple and white, with a mixture of the two;
the purple gradually changing, as it were, to a fiery red, and
the milk-white assuming a ruddy hue. Some persons praise
the edges of these vessels more particularly, with a kind of
reflection in the colours, like those beheld in the rain-bow.
Others, again, are more pleased with them when quite opaque,
it being considered a demerit when they are at all transparent,
or of a pallid hue. The appearance, too, of crystals<a id="FNanchor_2934_2934"></a><a href="#Footnote_2934_2934" class="fnanchor">2934</a> in them
is highly prized, and of spots that look like warts; not prominent,
but depressed, as we mostly see upon the human body.
The perfume,<a id="FNanchor_2935_2935"></a><a href="#Footnote_2935_2935" class="fnanchor">2935</a> too, of which they smell, is looked upon as an
additional recommendation.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_9"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 9‚ÄîTHE NATURE OF CRYSTAL.</span></h3></div>

<p>It is a diametrically opposite cause to this that produces
crystal,<a id="FNanchor_2936_2936"></a><a href="#Footnote_2936_2936" class="fnanchor">2936</a> a substance which assumes a concrete form from excessive
congelation.<a id="FNanchor_2937_2937"></a><a href="#Footnote_2937_2937" class="fnanchor">2937</a> At all events, crystal is only to be found
in places where the winter snow freezes with the greatest intensity;
and it is from the certainty that it is a kind of ice,
that it has received the name<a id="FNanchor_2938_2938"></a><a href="#Footnote_2938_2938" class="fnanchor">2938</a> which it bears in Greek. The
East, too, sends us crystal, there being none preferred to the produce
of India. It is to be found, also, in Asia, that of the vicinity
of Alabanda,<a id="FNanchor_2939_2939"></a><a href="#Footnote_2939_2939" class="fnanchor">2939</a> Orthosia,<a id="FNanchor_2940_2940"></a><a href="#Footnote_2940_2940" class="fnanchor">2940</a> and the neighbouring mountains,
being held in a very low degree of esteem. In Cyprus, also,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">395</a></span>there is crystal, but that found upon the Alpine heights in
Europe is, in general, more highly valued. According to
Juba, there is crystal in a certain island of the Red Sea, opposite
the coast of Arabia, called ‚ÄúNecron;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2941_2941"></a><a href="#Footnote_2941_2941" class="fnanchor">2941</a> as, also, in another
neighbouring island<a id="FNanchor_2942_2942"></a><a href="#Footnote_2942_2942" class="fnanchor">2942</a> which produces the precious stone
known as the ‚Äútopazus;‚Äù where a block of crystal was extracted,
he says, by Pythagoras, the pr√¶fect of King Ptolem√¶us,
no less than a cubit in length.</p>

<p>Cornelius Bocchus informs us that in Lusitania, there have
been blocks of crystal found, of extraordinary weight, in sinking
shafts in the Ammiensian<a id="FNanchor_2943_2943"></a><a href="#Footnote_2943_2943" class="fnanchor">2943</a> mountains there, to a water-level
for the supply of wells. It is a marvellous fact, stated by Xenocrates
of Ephesus, that in Asia and in the Isle of Cyprus,
crystal is turned up by the plough; it having been the general
belief that it is never to be found in terreous soils, and only
in rocky localities. That is much more probable which the
same Xenocrates tells us, when he says that the mountain
streams often bring down with them fragments of crystal.
Sudines says, that crystal is only to be found in localities that
face the south, a thing that is known to be really the fact:
indeed, it is never found in humid spots, however cold the
climate may be, even though the rivers there freeze to the very
bottom. Rain-water and pure snow are absolutely necessary
for its formation,<a id="FNanchor_2944_2944"></a><a href="#Footnote_2944_2944" class="fnanchor">2944</a> and hence it is, that it is unable to endure
heat, being solely employed for holding liquids that are taken
cold. From the circumstance of its being hexagonal<a id="FNanchor_2945_2945"></a><a href="#Footnote_2945_2945" class="fnanchor">2945</a> and
hexahedral, it is not easy to penetrate this substance; and the
more so, as the pyramidal terminations do not always have
the same appearance. The polish on its faces is so exquisite,
that no art can possibly equal it.</p>

DERIVED FROM CRYSTAL.</span></h3></div>

<p>The largest block of crystal that has ever been beheld by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">396</a></span>us, is the one that was consecrated by Julia Augusta in the Capitol,
and which weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds.<a id="FNanchor_2946_2946"></a><a href="#Footnote_2946_2946" class="fnanchor">2946</a>
Xenocrates speaks of having seen a vase of crystal, which held
one amphora,<a id="FNanchor_2947_2947"></a><a href="#Footnote_2947_2947" class="fnanchor">2947</a> and we find other writers mentioning a vessel
from India which held four sextarii. For my own part, I can
positively say, that there is crystal amid the crags of the Alps,
so difficult of access, that it is usually found necessary to be
suspended by ropes in order to extract it. Persons who are
experienced in the matter detect its presence by certain signs
and indications.</p>

<p>Crystal is subject to numerous defects, sometimes presenting
a rough, solder-like, substance, or else clouded by spots
upon it; while occasionally it contains some hidden humour<a id="FNanchor_2948_2948"></a><a href="#Footnote_2948_2948" class="fnanchor">2948</a>
within, or is traversed by hard and brittle knurrs,<a id="FNanchor_2949_2949"></a><a href="#Footnote_2949_2949" class="fnanchor">2949</a>
which are known as ‚Äúsalt grains.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2950_2950"></a><a href="#Footnote_2950_2950" class="fnanchor">2950</a>  Some crystal, too, has a
red rust upon it, while, in other instances, it contains filaments
that look like flaws, a defect which artists conceal by
engraving it. But where crystals are entirely free from defect,
they are preferred uncut; in which case, they are known
as ‚Äúacenteta,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2951_2951"></a><a href="#Footnote_2951_2951" class="fnanchor">2951</a>  and have the colour, not of foam, but of
limpid water. In the last place, the weight of crystals is a
point which is taken into consideration.</p>

<p>I find it stated by medical men that the very best cautery
for the human body is a ball of crystal acted upon by the rays
of the sun.<a id="FNanchor_2952_2952"></a><a href="#Footnote_2952_2952" class="fnanchor">2952</a>  This substance, too, has been made the object of
a mania; for, not many years ago, a mistress of a family,
who was by no means very rich, gave one hundred and fifty
thousand sesterces for a single basin made of crystal. Nero,
on receiving tidings that all was lost, in the excess of his
fury, dashed two cups of crystal to pieces; this being his last
act of vengeance upon his fellow-creatures, preventing any
one from ever drinking again from these vessels. Crystal,
when broken, cannot by any possibility be mended. Vessels in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">397</a></span>glass have been brought to a marvellous degree of resemblance
to crystal; and yet, wonderful to say, they have only tended
to enhance the value of crystal, and in no way to depreciate
it.</p>

CHAP. 11.‚ÄîAMBER: THE MANY FALSEHOODS THAT HAVE BEEN
TOLD ABOUT IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>Next in rank among the objects of luxury, we have amber;<a id="FNanchor_2953_2953"></a><a href="#Footnote_2953_2953" class="fnanchor">2953</a>
an article which, for the present, however, is in request among
women<a id="FNanchor_2954_2954"></a><a href="#Footnote_2954_2954" class="fnanchor">2954</a> only. All these three last-mentioned substances hold
the same rank, no doubt, as precious stones; the two former
for certain fair reasons; crystal, because it is adapted for
taking cool drinks, and murrhine vessels, for taking drinks that
are either hot or cold. But as for amber, luxury has not been
able, as yet, to devise any justification for the use of it. This
is a subject which affords us an excellent opportunity of exposing
some of the frivolities and falsehoods of the Greeks;
and I beg that my readers will only have patience with me
while I do so, it being really worth while, for our own practical
improvement, to become acquainted with the marvellous
stories which they have promulgated respecting amber.</p>

<p>After Pha√´thon had been struck by lightning, his sisters, they
tell us, became changed into poplars,<a id="FNanchor_2955_2955"></a><a href="#Footnote_2955_2955" class="fnanchor">2955</a> which every year shed
their tears upon the banks of the Eridanus, a river known to
us as the ‚ÄúPadus.‚Äù To these tears was given the name of ‚Äúelectrum,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2956_2956"></a><a href="#Footnote_2956_2956" class="fnanchor">2956</a>
from the circumstance that the Sun was usually called
‚Äúelector.‚Äù Such is the story, at all events, that is told by
many of the poets, the first of whom were, in my opinion,
√Üschylus, Philoxenus, Euripides, Satyrus, and Nicander; and
the falsity of which is abundantly proved upon the testimony
of Italy itself.<a id="FNanchor_2957_2957"></a><a href="#Footnote_2957_2957" class="fnanchor">2957</a> Those among the Greeks who have
devoted more attention to the subject, have spoken of certain
islands in the Adriatic Sea, known as the ‚ÄúElectrides,‚Äù and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">398</a></span>to which the Padus,<a id="FNanchor_2958_2958"></a><a href="#Footnote_2958_2958" class="fnanchor">2958</a> they say, carries down electrum. It is the
fact, however, that there never were any islands there so called,
nor, indeed, any islands so situate as to allow of the Padus
carrying down anything in its course to their shores. As to
√Üschylus placing the Eridanus in Iberia, or, in other words,
in Spain, and giving it the name of Rhodanus; and as to
Euripides and Apollonius representing the Rhodanus and the
Padus as discharging themselves by one common mouth on
the shores of the Adriatic; we can forgive them all the more
readily for knowing nothing about amber when they betray
such monstrous ignorance of geography.</p>

<p>Other writers, again, who are more guarded in their assertions,
have told us, though with an equal degree of untruthfulness,
that, at the extremity of the Adriatic Gulf, upon certain inaccessible
rocks there, there are certain trees<a id="FNanchor_2959_2959"></a><a href="#Footnote_2959_2959" class="fnanchor">2959</a> which shed their
gum at the rising of the Dog-Star. Theophrastus<a id="FNanchor_2960_2960"></a><a href="#Footnote_2960_2960" class="fnanchor">2960</a> has stated
that amber is extracted from the earth in Liguria;<a id="FNanchor_2961_2961"></a><a href="#Footnote_2961_2961" class="fnanchor">2961</a> Chares,
that Pha√´thon died in the territory of Hammon, in √Üthiopia,
where there is a temple of his and an oracle, and where amber
is produced; Philemon, that it is a fossil substance, and that
it is found in two different localities in Scythia, in one of
which it is of a white and waxen colour, and is known as
‚Äúelectrum;‚Äù while in the other it is red, and is called ‚Äúsualiternicum.‚Äù
Demostratus calls amber ‚Äúlyncurion,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2962_2962"></a><a href="#Footnote_2962_2962" class="fnanchor">2962</a> and he
says that it originates in the urine of the wild beast known as
the ‚Äúlynx;‚Äù that voided by the male producing a red and fiery
substance, and that by the female an amber of a white and
less pronounced colour: he also informs us that by some persons
it is called ‚Äúlangurium,‚Äù and that in Italy, there are
certain wild beasts known as ‚Äúlanguri.‚Äù Zeuothemis, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">399</a></span>calls these wild beasts ‚Äúlang√¶,‚Äù and gives the banks of
the river Padus as their locality. Sudines says, that it is a
tree in reality, that produces amber, and that, in Etruria, this
tree is known by the name of ‚Äúlynx;‚Äù an opinion which is
also adopted by Metrodorus. Sotacus expresses a belief that
amber exudes from certain stones in Britannia, to which he
gives the name of ‚Äúelectrides.‚Äù Pytheas says that the
Gutones,<a id="FNanchor_2963_2963"></a><a href="#Footnote_2963_2963" class="fnanchor">2963</a> a people of Germany, inhabit the shores of an
estuary of the Ocean called Mentonomon, their territory extending
a distance of six thousand stadia; that, at one day‚Äôs
sail from this territory, is the Isle of Abalus, upon the shores
of which, amber is thrown up by the waves in spring, it being
an excretion of the sea in a concrete form; as, also, that the
inhabitants use this amber by way of fuel, and sell it to their
neighbours, the Teutones. Tim√¶us, too, is of the same belief,
but he has given to the island the name of Basilia.<a id="FNanchor_2964_2964"></a><a href="#Footnote_2964_2964" class="fnanchor">2964</a></p>

<p>Philemon says that electrum does not yield a flame.<a id="FNanchor_2965_2965"></a><a href="#Footnote_2965_2965" class="fnanchor">2965</a> Nicias,
again, will have it, that it is a liquid produced by the rays of
the sun; and that these rays, at the moment of the sun‚Äôs
setting, striking with the greatest force upon the surface of
the soil, leave upon it an unctuous sweat, which is carried off
by the tides of the Ocean, and thrown up upon the shores of
Germany. He states, also, that in Egypt it is similarly produced,
and is there called ‚Äúsacal;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2966_2966"></a><a href="#Footnote_2966_2966" class="fnanchor">2966</a> that it is found in India,
too, where it is held as a preferable substitute for frankincense;
and that in Syria the women make the whirls of their
spindles of this substance, and give it the name of ‚Äúharpax,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2967_2967"></a><a href="#Footnote_2967_2967" class="fnanchor">2967</a>
from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff,
and the light fringe of tissues. According to Theochrestus,
amber is thrown up by the tides of the Ocean, at the foot of
the Pyren√¶an range; an opinion adopted also by Xenocrates.
Asarubas, who has written the most recently upon these subjects,
and is still living, informs us, that near the shores of the
Atlantic is Lake Cephisis, known to the Mauri by the name
of ‚ÄúElectrum;‚Äù and that when this lake is dried up by the
sun, the slime of it produces amber, which floats upon
the surface. Mnaseas speaks of a locality in Africa called
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">400</a></span>Sicyon, and of a river Crathis there, which discharges itself
from a lake into the Ocean, the banks of which are frequented
by birds which he calls ‚Äúmeleagrides‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2968_2968"></a><a href="#Footnote_2968_2968" class="fnanchor">2968</a> and ‚Äúpenelopes:‚Äù it is
here that, according to him, electrum is produced, in manner
above mentioned. Theomenes says that near the Greater
Syrtis are the Gardens of the Hesperides, and Lake Electrum:
on the banks, he says, are poplars, from the summits of which
amber falls into the water below, where it is gathered by the
maidens of the Hesperides.</p>

<p>Ctesias asserts that there is in India<a id="FNanchor_2969_2969"></a><a href="#Footnote_2969_2969" class="fnanchor">2969</a> a river called Hypobarus,
a word which signifies ‚Äúbearer of all good things;‚Äù
that this river flows from the north into the Eastern Ocean,
where it discharges itself near a mountain covered with trees
which produce electrum; and that these trees are called
‚Äúsiptachor√¶,‚Äù the meaning of which is ‚Äúintense sweetness.‚Äù
Mithridates says, that off the shores of Germany there is an
island called ‚ÄúSerita,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2970_2970"></a><a href="#Footnote_2970_2970" class="fnanchor">2970</a> covered with a kind of cedar, from
which amber falls upon the rocks. According to Xenocrates,
this substance is called, in Italy, not only ‚Äúsuccinum,‚Äù but
‚Äúthieum‚Äù as well, the Scythian name of it, for there also it
is to be found, being ‚Äúsacrium:‚Äù others, he says, are of opinion
that it is a product of Numidia. But the one that has
surpassed them all is Sophocles, the tragic poet; a thing that
indeed surprises me, when I only consider the surpassing
gravity of his lofty style, the high repute that he enjoyed in
life, his elevated position by birth at Athens, his various exploits,
and his high military command. According to him,
amber is produced in the countries beyond India, from the tears
that are shed for Meleager, by the birds called ‚Äúmeleagrides!‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2971_2971"></a><a href="#Footnote_2971_2971" class="fnanchor">2971</a>
Who can be otherwise than surprised that he should have believed
such a thing as this, or have hoped to persuade others
to believe it? What child, too, could possibly be found in such
a state of ignorance as to believe that birds weep once a year,
that their tears are so prolific as this, or that they go all the
way from Greece, where Meleager died, to India to weep?
‚ÄúBut then,‚Äù it will be said, ‚Äúdo not the poets tell many other
stories that are quite as fabulous?‚Äù Such is the fact, no doubt,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">401</a></span>but for a person seriously to advance such an absurdity with
reference to a thing so common as amber, which is imported
every day and so easily proves the mendacity of this assertion,
is neither more nor less than to evince a supreme contempt
for the opinions of mankind, and to assert with impunity an
intolerable falsehood.</p>

<p>(3.) There can be no doubt that amber is a product of the
islands of the Northern Ocean, and that it is the substance by
the Germans called ‚Äúgl√¶sum;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2972_2972"></a><a href="#Footnote_2972_2972" class="fnanchor">2972</a> for which reason the Romans,
when Germanicus C√¶sar commanded the fleet in those parts,
gave to one of these islands the name of Gl√¶saria,<a id="FNanchor_2973_2973"></a><a href="#Footnote_2973_2973" class="fnanchor">2973</a> which by the
barbarians was known as Austeravia. Amber is produced from
a marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine<a id="FNanchor_2974_2974"></a><a href="#Footnote_2974_2974" class="fnanchor">2974</a> genus, like
gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine. It is
a liquid at first, which issues forth in considerable quantities,
and is gradually hardened by heat or cold, or else by the action
of the sea, when the rise of the tide carries off the fragments
from the shores of these islands. At all events, it is thrown
up upon the coasts, in so light and voluble a form that in the
shallows it has all the appearance of hanging suspended in the
water. Our forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice
of a tree, and for this reason gave it the name of ‚Äúsuccinum:‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2975_2975"></a><a href="#Footnote_2975_2975" class="fnanchor">2975</a>
and one great proof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine
genus, is the fact that it emits a pine-like smell when rubbed,
and that it burns, when ignited, with the odour and appearance
of torch-pine wood.</p>

<p>Amber is imported by the Germans into Pannonia, more
particularly; from whence the Veneti, by the Greeks called
Eneti, first brought it into general notice, a people in the
vicinity of Pannonia, and dwelling on the shores of the
Adriatic Sea. From this it is evident how the story which
connects it with the Padus first originated; and at the present
day we see the female peasantry in the countries that lie
beyond that river wearing necklaces of amber, principally
as an ornament, no doubt, but on account of its remedial virtues
as well; for amber, it is generally believed, is good for affections
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">402</a></span>of the tonsillary glands and fauces, the various kinds of
water in the vicinity of the Alps being apt to produce disease
in the human throat.<a id="FNanchor_2976_2976"></a><a href="#Footnote_2976_2976" class="fnanchor">2976</a></p>

<p>From Carnuntum in Pannonia, to the coasts of Germany
from which the amber is brought, is a distance of about six
hundred miles, a fact which has been only very recently ascertained;
and there is still living a member of the equestrian
order, who was sent thither by Julianus, the manager of the
gladiatorial exhibitions for the Emperor Nero, to procure a
supply of this article. Traversing the coasts of that country
and visiting the various markets there, he brought back amber,
in such vast quantities, as to admit of the nets, which are used
for protecting the podium<a id="FNanchor_2977_2977"></a><a href="#Footnote_2977_2977" class="fnanchor">2977</a> against the wild beasts, being
studded<a id="FNanchor_2978_2978"></a><a href="#Footnote_2978_2978" class="fnanchor">2978</a> with amber.</p>

<p>The arms too, the litters,<a id="FNanchor_2979_2979"></a><a href="#Footnote_2979_2979" class="fnanchor">2979</a> and all the other apparatus, were,
on one day, decorated with nothing but amber, a different kind
of display being made each day that these spectacles were exhibited.
The largest piece of amber that this personage brought
to Rome was thirteen pounds in weight.</p>

<p>That amber is found in India too, is a fact well ascertained.
Archela√ºs, who reigned over Cappadocia, says that it is brought
from that country in the rough state, and with the fine bark
still adhering to it, it being the custom there to polish it by
boiling it in the grease of a sucking-pig. One great proof that
amber must have been originally in a liquid state, is the fact
that, owing to its transparency, certain objects are to be seen
within, ants for example, gnats, and lizards. These, no doubt,
must have first adhered to it while liquid, and then, upon its
hardening, have remained enclosed within.<a id="FNanchor_2980_2980"></a><a href="#Footnote_2980_2980" class="fnanchor">2980</a></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_12"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 12.‚ÄîTHE SEVERAL KINDS OF AMBER: THE REMEDIES
DERIVED FROM IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are several kinds<a id="FNanchor_2981_2981"></a><a href="#Footnote_2981_2981" class="fnanchor">2981</a> of amber. The white is the one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">403</a></span>that has the finest odour;<a id="FNanchor_2982_2982"></a><a href="#Footnote_2982_2982" class="fnanchor">2982</a> but neither this nor the wax-coloured
amber is held in very high esteem. The red amber is more
highly valued; and still more so, when it is transparent, without
presenting too brilliant and igneous an appearance. For
amber, to be of high quality, should present a brightness like
that of fire, but not flakes resembling those of flame. The
most highly esteemed amber is that known as the ‚ÄúFalernian,‚Äù
from its resemblance to the colour of Falernian wine; it is
perfectly transparent, and has a softened, transparent, brightness.
Other kinds, again, are valued for their mellowed tints, like the
colour of boiled honey in appearance. It ought to be known,
however, that any colour can be imparted to amber that may
be desired, it being sometimes stained with kid-suet and root
of alkanet; indeed, at the present day, amber is dyed purple
even. When a vivifying heat has been imparted to it by
rubbing it between the fingers, amber will attract chaff, dried
leaves, and thin bark, just in the same way that the magnet
attracts iron. Pieces of amber, steeped in oil, burn with a more
brilliant and more lasting flame than pith of flax.<a id="FNanchor_2983_2983"></a><a href="#Footnote_2983_2983" class="fnanchor">2983</a></p>

<p>So highly valued is this as an object of luxury, that a very
diminutive human effigy, made of amber, has been known to sell
at a higher price than living men even, in stout and vigorous
health. This single ground for censure, however, is far from
being sufficient; in Corinthian objects of vertu, it is the copper
that recommends them, combined with silver and gold; and in
embossed works it is the skill and genius of the artist that
is so highly esteemed. We have already said what it is that
recommends vessels of murrhine and of crystal; pearls, too, are
of use for wearing upon the head, and gems upon the fingers.
In the case of all other luxuries, in fact, it is either a spirit of
ostentation or some utility that has been discovered in them
that pleads so strongly in their behalf; but in that of amber
we have solely the consciousness that we are enjoying a luxury,
and nothing more. Domitius Nero, among the other portentous
extravagances of his life, bestowed this name upon the
ringlets of his wife Popp√¶a, and, in certain verses of his, he has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">404</a></span>even gone so far as to call them ‚Äúsuccini.‚Äù As fine names,
too, are never wanting for bodily defects, a third tint has been
introduced of late for hair among our ladies, under the name of
‚Äúamber-colour.‚Äù</p>

<p>Amber, however, is not without its utility in a medicinal
point of view; though it is not for this reason that the women
are so pleased with it. It is beneficial for infants also, attached
to the body in the form of an amulet; and, according to Callistratus,
it is good for any age, as a preventive of delirium and as
a cure for strangury, either taken in drink or attached as an
amulet to the body. This last author, too, has invented a new
variety of amber; giving the name of ‚Äúchryselectrum‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2984_2984"></a><a href="#Footnote_2984_2984" class="fnanchor">2984</a> to an
amber of a golden colour, and which presents the most beautiful
tints in the morning. This last kind attracts flame, too,
with the greatest rapidity, and, the moment it approaches the
fire, it ignites. ‚ÄúWorn upon the neck, he says, it is a cure
for fevers and other diseases, and, triturated with honey and
oil of roses, it is good for maladies of the ears. Beaten up
with Attic honey, it is good for dimness of sight: and the
powder of it, either taken by itself or with gum mastich in
water, is remedial for diseases of the stomach. Amber, too, is
greatly in request for the imitation of the transparent precious
stones, amethystos in particular: for, as already stated, it
admits of being dyed of every colour.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_13"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 13.‚ÄîLYNCURUIM: TWO ASSERTED REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The pertinacity that has been displayed by certain authors
compels me to speak of lyncurium<a id="FNanchor_2985_2985"></a><a href="#Footnote_2985_2985" class="fnanchor">2985</a> next; for even those who
maintain that it is not a variety of amber, still assure us that
it is a precious stone. They assert, too, that it is a product of
the urine of the lynx and of a kind of earth, the animal
covering up the urine the moment it has voided it, from a
jealousy that man should gain possession of it; a combination
which hardens into stone. The colour of it, they inform us,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">405</a></span>like that of some kinds of amber, is of a fiery<a id="FNanchor_2986_2986"></a><a href="#Footnote_2986_2986" class="fnanchor">2986</a> hue, and it admits,
they say, of being engraved. They assert, too, that this
substance attracts<a id="FNanchor_2987_2987"></a><a href="#Footnote_2987_2987" class="fnanchor">2987</a> to itself not only leaves or straws, but thin
plates of copper even or of iron; a story which Theophrastus
even believes, on the faith of a certain Diocles.</p>

<p>For my own part, I look upon the whole of these statements
as untrue, and I do not believe that in our time there
has ever been a precious stone seen with such a name as this.
I regard, too, the assertions that have been made as to its
medicinal properties, as equally false; to the effect that, taken
in drink, it disperses urinary calculi, and that, taken in wine,
or only looked at, it is curative of jaundice.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to speak of the various kinds of precious
stones, the existence of which is generally admitted,
beginning with those which are the most highly esteemed.
Nor shall we content ourselves with doing this only; but, with
the view of consulting the general welfare of mankind, we
shall also refute the infamous lies that have been promulgated
by the magicians: for it is with reference to precious stones,
more particularly, that they have circulated most of their

ascertaining remedial virtues, beyond all bounds, and entering

CHAP. 15. (4.)‚ÄîADAMAS: SIX VARIETIES OF IT. TWO REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The substance that possesses the greatest value, not only
among the precious stones, but of all human possessions, is
adamas;<a id="FNanchor_2988_2988"></a><a href="#Footnote_2988_2988" class="fnanchor">2988</a> mineral which, for a long time, was known to kings
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">406</a></span>only, and to very few of them. Such was the name given to
a nodosity of gold,<a id="FNanchor_2989_2989"></a><a href="#Footnote_2989_2989" class="fnanchor">2989</a> sometimes, though but rarely, found in the
mines, in close proximity with gold, and only there to be
found, it was thought. The ancients supposed that adamas
was only to be discovered in the mines of √Üthiopia,<a id="FNanchor_2990_2990"></a><a href="#Footnote_2990_2990" class="fnanchor">2990</a> between
the Temple of Mercury and the island of Mero√´; and they
have informed us that it was never larger than a cucumber-seed,
or differing at all from it in colour.</p>

<p>At the present day, for the first time, there are no less than
six different varieties of it recognized. The Indian adamas is
found, not in a stratum of gold, but in a substance of a
kindred nature to crystal; which it closely resembles in its
transparency and its highly polished hexangular and hexahedral<a id="FNanchor_2991_2991"></a><a href="#Footnote_2991_2991" class="fnanchor">2991</a>
form. In shape it is turbinated, running to a point at
either extremity, and closely resembling, marvellous to think
of, two cones united at the base. In size, too, it is as large
even as a hazel-nut. Resembling that of India, is the adamas<a id="FNanchor_2992_2992"></a><a href="#Footnote_2992_2992" class="fnanchor">2992</a>
of Arabia, which is found in a similar bed, but not so large in
size. Other varieties have a pallid hue like that of silver,
and are only to be found in the midst of gold of the very
finest quality. These stones are tested upon the anvil, and
will resist the blow to such an extent, as to make the iron rebound
and the very anvil split asunder.<a id="FNanchor_2993_2993"></a><a href="#Footnote_2993_2993" class="fnanchor">2993</a> Indeed its hardness
is beyond all expression, while at the same time it quite sets
fire at defiance<a id="FNanchor_2994_2994"></a><a href="#Footnote_2994_2994" class="fnanchor">2994</a> and is incapable of being heated; owing to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">407</a></span>which indomitable powers it is, that it has received the name
which it derives from the Greek.<a id="FNanchor_2995_2995"></a><a href="#Footnote_2995_2995" class="fnanchor">2995</a></p>

<p>One kind, about as large as a grain of millet in size, has been
called ‚Äúcenchros,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2996_2996"></a><a href="#Footnote_2996_2996" class="fnanchor">2996</a> and another,<a id="FNanchor_2997_2997"></a><a href="#Footnote_2997_2997" class="fnanchor">2997</a> that is found in the gold
mines at Philippi, is known as the ‚ÄúMacedonian‚Äù adamas:
this last is about as large as a cucumber-seed in size. We next
come to the Cyprian<a id="FNanchor_2998_2998"></a><a href="#Footnote_2998_2998" class="fnanchor">2998</a> adamas, so called from its being found
in the Isle of Cyprus: it is of a colour somewhat inclining to
that of copper, but, in reference to its medicinal virtues, of
which we shall have to make further mention, it is the most
efficacious of them all. Next in succession to this we have
siderites,<a id="FNanchor_2999_2999"></a><a href="#Footnote_2999_2999" class="fnanchor">2999</a> a stone which shines like iron, and is more ponderous
than any of the others, but differs in its properties from them
all. For it breaks when struck by the hammer, and admits of
being perforated by other kinds of adamas; a thing which is
the case, also, with that of Cyprus: in short, these two are
degenerate stones, and only bear the name of ‚Äúadamas‚Äù for
the purpose of enhancing their value.</p>

<p>Now with reference to those affinities and repugnances which
exist between certain objects, known to the Greeks as ‚Äúsympathia‚Äù
and ‚Äúantipathia,‚Äù ph√¶nomena to which we have endeavoured<a id="FNanchor_3000_3000"></a><a href="#Footnote_3000_3000" class="fnanchor">3000</a>
to draw attention throughout these books, they nowhere
manifest themselves with greater distinctness than here.
This indomitable power, in fact, which sets at nought the
two most violent agents in Nature, fire, namely, and iron, is
made to yield before the blood of a he-goat.<a id="FNanchor_3001_3001"></a><a href="#Footnote_3001_3001" class="fnanchor">3001</a> The blood,
however must be no otherwise than fresh and warm; the stone,
too, must be well steeped in it, and then subjected to repeated
blows: and even then, it is apt to break both anvils and hammers
of iron, if they are not of the very finest temper. To
what spirit of research, or to what accident, are we indebted for
this discovery? or what conjecture can it have been, that first
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">408</a></span>led man to experiment upon a thing of such extraordinary
value as this, and that, too, with the most unclean<a id="FNanchor_3002_3002"></a><a href="#Footnote_3002_3002" class="fnanchor">3002</a> of all
animals? Surely a discovery, such as this, must have been due
solely to the munificence of the gods, and we must look for
the reason of it in none of the elementary operations of
Nature, but wholly in her will.</p>

<p>When, by good fortune, this stone does happen to be broken,
it divides into fragments so minute as to be almost imperceptible.
These particles are held in great request by engravers,
who enclose them in iron, and are enabled thereby, with the
greatest facility, to cut<a id="FNanchor_3003_3003"></a><a href="#Footnote_3003_3003" class="fnanchor">3003</a> the very hardest substances known.
So great is the antipathy borne by this stone to the magnet,
that when placed near, it will not allow of its attracting
iron; or if the magnet has already attracted the iron, it will
seize the metal and drag it away from the other.<a id="FNanchor_3004_3004"></a><a href="#Footnote_3004_3004" class="fnanchor">3004</a> Adamas,
too, overcomes and neutralizes poisons, dispels delirium, and
banishes groundless perturbations of the mind; hence it is
that some have given it the name of ‚Äúananchites.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3005_3005"></a><a href="#Footnote_3005_3005" class="fnanchor">3005</a> Metrodorus
of Scepsis is the only author, that I know of, who says
that this stone is found also in Germany, and in the island of
Basilia,<a id="FNanchor_3006_3006"></a><a href="#Footnote_3006_3006" class="fnanchor">3006</a> where amber is found. He says, too, that this is preferable
to the stone of Arabia; but can there be any doubt
that his statement is incorrect?</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_16"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 16.‚Äî-SMARAGDUS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Next<a id="FNanchor_3007_3007"></a><a href="#Footnote_3007_3007" class="fnanchor">3007</a> in esteem with us are the pearls of India and Arabia,
of which we have already spoken in the Ninth Book,<a id="FNanchor_3008_3008"></a><a href="#Footnote_3008_3008" class="fnanchor">3008</a> when
treating of the marine productions.</p>

<p>(5.) The third rank, for many reasons, has been given to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">409</a></span>the smaragdus.<a id="FNanchor_3009_3009"></a><a href="#Footnote_3009_3009" class="fnanchor">3009</a> Indeed there is no stone, the colour of which
is more delightful to the eye; for whereas the sight fixes itself
with avidity upon the green<a id="FNanchor_3010_3010"></a><a href="#Footnote_3010_3010" class="fnanchor">3010</a> grass and the foliage of the trees,
we have all the more pleasure in looking upon the smaragdus,
there being no green in existence of a more intense colour<a id="FNanchor_3011_3011"></a><a href="#Footnote_3011_3011" class="fnanchor">3011</a>
than this. And then, besides, of all the precious stones, this is
the only one that feeds the sight without satiating it. Even
when the vision has been fatigued with intently viewing other
objects, it is refreshed by being turned upon this stone; and
lapidaries know of nothing that is more gratefully soothing to
the eyes, its soft green tints being wonderfully adapted for
assuaging lassitude, when felt in those organs.</p>

<p>And then, besides, when viewed from a distance, these stones
appear all the larger to the sight, reflecting as they do, their
green hues upon the circumambient air. Neither sunshine,
shade, nor artificial light effects any change in their appearance;
they have always a softened and graduated brilliancy; and
transmitting the light with facility, they allow the vision to
penetrate their interior; a property which is so pleasing, also,
with reference to water. In form they are mostly concave, so
as to re-unite the rays of light and the powers of vision:
and hence it is, that it is so universally agreed upon among
mankind to respect these stones, and to forbid their surface<a id="FNanchor_3012_3012"></a><a href="#Footnote_3012_3012" class="fnanchor">3012</a>
to be engraved. In the case, however, of the stones of Scythia
and Egypt, their hardness is such, that it would be quite impossible
to penetrate them. When the surface of the smaragdus
is flat, it reflects the image of objects in the same manner as
a mirror. The Emperor Nero used to view<a id="FNanchor_3013_3013"></a><a href="#Footnote_3013_3013" class="fnanchor">3013</a> the combats of
the gladiators upon a smaragdus.</p>

<div class="section">

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_17"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 17.‚ÄîTWELVE VARIETIES OF THE SMARAGDUS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Of this stone there are no less than twelve different kinds;
of which the finest is the Scythian<a id="FNanchor_3014_3014"></a><a href="#Footnote_3014_3014" class="fnanchor">3014</a> smaragdus, so called from
the country where it is found. None of them has a deeper
colour than this, or is more free from defects: indeed, in the
same degree that the smaragdus is superior to other precious
stones, the Scythian smaragdus is superior to the other varieties.
Next in esteem to this, as also in locality, is the smaragdus
of Bactriana.<a id="FNanchor_3015_3015"></a><a href="#Footnote_3015_3015" class="fnanchor">3015</a> These stones are collected, it is said, in the
fissures of rocks, when the Etesian<a id="FNanchor_3016_3016"></a><a href="#Footnote_3016_3016" class="fnanchor">3016</a> winds prevail; a period
at which the earth that covers them is removed, and the stones
are detected by their brightness, the sands being greatly agitated
by the action of the winds. These last, however, are
much inferior, they say, to those of Scythia in size. The third
rank is held by the stones of Egypt,<a id="FNanchor_3017_3017"></a><a href="#Footnote_3017_3017" class="fnanchor">3017</a> which are extracted from
the hills in the vicinity of Coptos, a city of Thebais.</p>

<p>All the other kinds are found in copper-mines, and hence it
is that, of these varieties, the smaragdus of Cyprus holds the
highest rank. The merit of them consists in their clear colour,
which has nothing thin or diluted in it, but presents a rich
and humid transparency, closely resembling the tints of the
sea, in fact. Hence it is that these stones are at once diaphanous
and shining, or, in other words, reflect their colours and
allow the vision to penetrate within. They say that in this
island, upon the tomb of a petty king named Hermias, near
the fisheries<a id="FNanchor_3018_3018"></a><a href="#Footnote_3018_3018" class="fnanchor">3018</a> there, there was formerly a lion in marble, with
eyes made of smaragdi; the brilliancy of which penetrated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">411</a></span>the sea to such a degree, as to alarm the tunnies and put them
to flight: a novel circumstance, which for a long time excited
wonder in the fishermen, till at last the stones in the statue
were changed for others.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_18"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 18.‚ÄîDEFECTS IN THE SMARAGDUS.</span></h3></div>

<p>It will be only proper, too, seeing that the prices of these
stones are so exorbitant, to point out their defects. Some
defects, no doubt, are common to all of them, while others,
again, like those found in the human race, are peculiar only
to those of a certain country. Thus, for example, the stones
of Cyprus are not all green alike, and in the same smaragdus
some parts are more or less so than others, the stone not always
preserving that uniform deep tint which characterizes the smaragdus
of Scythia. In other instances, a shadow runs through
the stone, and the colour becomes dulled thereby; the consequence
of which is, that its value is depreciated; and even
more so, when the colour is thin and diluted.</p>

<p>In consequence of the defects<a id="FNanchor_3019_3019"></a><a href="#Footnote_3019_3019" class="fnanchor">3019</a> in these stones, they have
been divided into several classes. Some of them are obscure,
and are then known as ‚Äúblind‚Äù stones; some have a certain
density, which impairs their transparency; others, again, are
mottled, and others covered with a cloud. This cloud, however,
is altogether different from the shadow above mentioned;
for it is a defect which renders the stone of a whitish hue, and
not of a transparent green throughout; presenting, as it does, in
the interior or upon the surface, a certain degree of whiteness
which arrests the vision. Other defects, again, in these stones,
are filaments, salt-like<a id="FNanchor_3020_3020"></a><a href="#Footnote_3020_3020" class="fnanchor">3020</a> grains, or traces of lead ore, faults
which are mostly common to them all.</p>

<p>Next after the kinds above described, the smaragdus of
√Üthiopia is held in high esteem; being found, as Juba tells
us, at a distance of twenty-five days‚Äô journey from Coptos.
These are of a bright green, but are seldom to be met with perfectly
clear or of an uniform colour. Democritus includes in
this class the stones that are known as ‚Äúherminei,‚Äù and as
‚ÄúPersian‚Äù stones; the former of which are of a convex,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">412</a></span>massive shape, while the latter are destitute of transparency,
but have an agreeable, uniform colour, and satisfy the vision
without allowing it to penetrate them; strongly resembling, in
this respect, the eyes of cats and of panthers, which are radiant
without being diaphanous. In the sun, he says, they lose their
brilliancy, but they are radiant in the shade, the brightness of
them being seen at a greater distance than in the case of other
stones. One other fault, too, in all these stones is, that they
often have a colour like that of honey or rancid oil, or else
are clear and transparent, but not green.</p>

<p>These defects exist in the smaragdi of Attica,<a id="FNanchor_3021_3021"></a><a href="#Footnote_3021_3021" class="fnanchor">3021</a> more particularly,
which are found in the silver-mines there, at a place
known by the name of Thoricos.<a id="FNanchor_3022_3022"></a><a href="#Footnote_3022_3022" class="fnanchor">3022</a> These last are never so
massive as the others, and are always more pleasing to the
sight when viewed from a distance: lead ore, too, is often to
be detected in them, or, in other words, they have a leaden
appearance when looked at in the sun.<a id="FNanchor_3023_3023"></a><a href="#Footnote_3023_3023" class="fnanchor">3023</a> One peculiarity in
them is, that some of them become impaired by age, gradually
lose their green colour, and are even deteriorated by exposure
to the sun. Next to the stones of Attica come those of
Media, a variety which presents the most numerous tints of all,
and sometimes approaches sapphiros<a id="FNanchor_3024_3024"></a><a href="#Footnote_3024_3024" class="fnanchor">3024</a> in colour. These stones
are wavy,<a id="FNanchor_3025_3025"></a><a href="#Footnote_3025_3025" class="fnanchor">3025</a> and represent various natural objects, such as
poppy-heads, for example, birds, the young of animals, and
feathers: all of them appear naturally of a green colour, but
become improved by the application of oil. No stones of this
species are of a larger size than these.</p>

<p>I am not aware that any of these stones<a id="FNanchor_3026_3026"></a><a href="#Footnote_3026_3026" class="fnanchor">3026</a> are still in existence
at Chalcedon, the copper mines of that locality being now
exhausted: but be this as it may, they were always the smallest
in size and the most inferior in value. Brittle, and of a colour
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">413</a></span>far from distinctly pronounced, they resembled in their tints
the feathers that are seen in the tail of the peacock or on the
necks of pigeons.<a id="FNanchor_3027_3027"></a><a href="#Footnote_3027_3027" class="fnanchor">3027</a> More or less brilliant, too, according to the
angle at which they were viewed, they presented an appearance
like that of veins and scales. There was another defect, also,
peculiar to these stones, known as ‚Äúsarcion,‚Äù from the circumstance
that a kind of flesh<a id="FNanchor_3028_3028"></a><a href="#Footnote_3028_3028" class="fnanchor">3028</a> appeared to attach itself to the
stone. The mountain near Chalcedon, where these stones were
gathered, is still known by the name of ‚ÄúSmaragdites.‚Äù Juba
informs us that a kind of smaragdus, known as ‚Äúcloras,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3029_3029"></a><a href="#Footnote_3029_3029" class="fnanchor">3029</a> is
used in Arabia as an ornament for buildings, as also the stone
which by the people of Egypt is called ‚Äúalabastrites.‚Äù On the
same authority, too, we learn that there are several varieties
of the smaragdus in the neighbouring mountains, and that
stones like those of Media are found in Mount Taygetus,<a id="FNanchor_3030_3030"></a><a href="#Footnote_3030_3030" class="fnanchor">3030</a> as
also in Sicily.</p>

<p>Among the smaragdi is also included the precious stone
known as ‚Äútanos.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3031_3031"></a><a href="#Footnote_3031_3031" class="fnanchor">3031</a> It comes from Persia, and is of an
unsightly green, and of a soiled colour within. There is the
chalcosmaragdos<a id="FNanchor_3032_3032"></a><a href="#Footnote_3032_3032" class="fnanchor">3032</a> also, a native of Cyprus, the face of which is
mottled with coppery veins. Theophrastus relates that he
had found it stated in the Egyptian histories, that a king of
Babylon once sent to the king of Egypt a smaragdus<a id="FNanchor_3033_3033"></a><a href="#Footnote_3033_3033" class="fnanchor">3033</a> four
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">414</a></span>cubits in length by three in breadth. He informs us, also, that
in a temple of Jupiter in Egypt there was an obelisk made of
four smaragdi, forty cubits in length, and four in breadth at
one extremity, and two at the other. He says, too, that at
the period at which he wrote, there was in the Temple of Hercules
at Tyrus a large column made of a single smaragdus;<a id="FNanchor_3034_3034"></a><a href="#Footnote_3034_3034" class="fnanchor">3034</a>
though very possibly it might only be pseudo-smaragdus, a
kind of stone not uncommonly found in Cyprus, where a block
had been discovered, composed, one half of smaragdus, and
one half of jasper,<a id="FNanchor_3035_3035"></a><a href="#Footnote_3035_3035" class="fnanchor">3035</a> and the liquid in which had not as yet

CHAP. 20.‚ÄîBERYLS: EIGHT VARIETIES OF THEM. DEFECTS IN
BERYLS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Beryls, it is thought, are of the same<a id="FNanchor_3037_3037"></a><a href="#Footnote_3037_3037" class="fnanchor">3037</a> nature as the smaragdus,
or at least closely analogous. India<a id="FNanchor_3038_3038"></a><a href="#Footnote_3038_3038" class="fnanchor">3038</a> produces them, and
they are rarely to be found elsewhere. The lapidaries cut all
beryls of an hexagonal<a id="FNanchor_3039_3039"></a><a href="#Footnote_3039_3039" class="fnanchor">3039</a> form; because the colour, which is
deadened by a dull uniformity of surface, is heightened by the
reflection resulting from the angles. If they are cut in any
other way, these stones have no brilliancy whatever. The most
esteemed beryls are those which in colour resemble the pure
green of the sea;<a id="FNanchor_3040_3040"></a><a href="#Footnote_3040_3040" class="fnanchor">3040</a> the chrysoberyl<a id="FNanchor_3041_3041"></a><a href="#Footnote_3041_3041" class="fnanchor">3041</a> being next in value, a stone
of a somewhat paler colour, but approaching a golden tint.
Closely allied to this last in its brilliancy, but of a more pallid
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">415</a></span>colour, and thought by some to constitute a separate genus, is
chrysoprasus.<a id="FNanchor_3042_3042"></a><a href="#Footnote_3042_3042" class="fnanchor">3042</a> In the fourth rank are reckoned the hyacinthine
beryls; and in the fifth, those known as ‚Äúa√´roides.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3043_3043"></a><a href="#Footnote_3043_3043" class="fnanchor">3043</a>
Next, we have the wax-coloured beryls, and, after them, the
oleaginous beryls, so called from the resemblance of their colour
to that of oil. Last of all, there are the stones which closely
resemble crystal in appearance; mostly disfigured by spots and
filaments, and of a poor, faint, colour as well; all of them so
many imperfections in the stone.</p>

<p>The people of India are marvellously fond of beryls of an
elongated<a id="FNanchor_3044_3044"></a><a href="#Footnote_3044_3044" class="fnanchor">3044</a> form, and say that these are the only precious stones
they prefer wearing without the addition of gold: hence it is
that, after piercing them, they string them upon the bristles of
the elephant. It is generally agreed, however, that those
stones should not be perforated which are of the finest quality;
and in this case they only enclose the extremities of them in
studs of gold. They prefer, too, cutting the beryls in a cylindrical
form, instead of setting them as precious stones; an elongated
shape being the one that is most highly esteemed. Some
are of opinion that beryls are naturally angular,<a id="FNanchor_3045_3045"></a><a href="#Footnote_3045_3045" class="fnanchor">3045</a> and that
when pierced they become improved in colour; the white substance
being thus removed that lies within, and their brilliancy
heightened by the reflection of the gold in which they are set;
or, at all events, their transparency being increased by this
diminution in their thickness. In addition to the defects
already<a id="FNanchor_3046_3046"></a><a href="#Footnote_3046_3046" class="fnanchor">3046</a> mentioned, and which are pretty nearly the same as
those to which the smaragdus is subject, beryls are affected with
cloudy spots,<a id="FNanchor_3047_3047"></a><a href="#Footnote_3047_3047" class="fnanchor">3047</a> like those on the finger-nails in appearance. In
our own part of the world, it is thought that they are sometimes
found in the countries that lie in the vicinity of Pontus.<a id="FNanchor_3048_3048"></a><a href="#Footnote_3048_3048" class="fnanchor">3048</a> The
people of India, by colouring crystal, have found a method of
imitating various precious stones, beryls in particular.</p>

CHAP. 21. (6.)‚ÄîOPALS: SEVEN VARIETIES OF THEM.</span></h3></div>

<p>Opals<a id="FNanchor_3049_3049"></a><a href="#Footnote_3049_3049" class="fnanchor">3049</a> are at once very similar to, and very different from,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">416</a></span>beryls, and only yield to the smaragdus in value. India, too,
is the sole<a id="FNanchor_3050_3050"></a><a href="#Footnote_3050_3050" class="fnanchor">3050</a> parent of these precious stones, thus completing
her glory as being the great producer of the most costly gems.
Of all precious stones, it is opal that presents the greatest difficulties
of description, it displaying at once the piercing fire
of carbunculus,<a id="FNanchor_3051_3051"></a><a href="#Footnote_3051_3051" class="fnanchor">3051</a> the purple brilliancy of amethystos, and the
sea-green of smaragdus, the whole blended together and refulgent
with a brightness that is quite incredible. Some authors
have compared the effect of its refulgence to that of the colour
known as Armenian<a id="FNanchor_3052_3052"></a><a href="#Footnote_3052_3052" class="fnanchor">3052</a> pigment, while others speak of it as resembling
the flame of burning sulphur, or of flame fed with
oil. In size, the opal is about as large as a hazel-nut,<a id="FNanchor_3053_3053"></a><a href="#Footnote_3053_3053" class="fnanchor">3053</a> and,
with reference to it, there is a remarkable historical anecdote
related. For there is still in existence a stone of this class, on
account of which Antonius proscribed the senator Nonius, son
of the Nonius Struma, whom the poet Catullus<a id="FNanchor_3054_3054"></a><a href="#Footnote_3054_3054" class="fnanchor">3054</a> was so displeased
at seeing in the curule chair, and grandfather of the
Servilius Nonianus, who in our own times was consul.<a id="FNanchor_3055_3055"></a><a href="#Footnote_3055_3055" class="fnanchor">3055</a> On
being thus proscribed, Nonius took to flight, carrying with
him, out of all his wealth, nothing but this ring, the value of
which, it is well known, was estimated at two millions of sesterces.
How marvellous must have been the cruelty, how marvellous
the luxurious passion of Antonius, thus to proscribe a
man for the possession of a jewel! and no less marvellous must
have been the obstinacy of Nonius, who could thus dote upon
what had been the cause of his proscription; for we see the
very brutes even tear off the portion of their body for the sake
of which they know their existence to be imperilled,<a id="FNanchor_3056_3056"></a><a href="#Footnote_3056_3056" class="fnanchor">3056</a> and so
redeem themselves by parting with it.</p>

CHAP. 22.‚ÄîDEFECTS IN OPALS: THE MODES OF TESTING THEM.</span></h3></div>

<p>Defects in opal are, a colour inclining to that of the flower
called heliotropium,<a id="FNanchor_3057_3057"></a><a href="#Footnote_3057_3057" class="fnanchor">3057</a> or to that of crystal or of hailstones; salt-like
grains intervening; roughness on the surface; or sharp
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">417</a></span>points, presenting themselves to the eye. There is no stone
that is imitated by fraudulent dealers with more exactness than
this, in glass, the only mode of detecting the imposition being
by the light of the sun. For when a false<a id="FNanchor_3058_3058"></a><a href="#Footnote_3058_3058" class="fnanchor">3058</a> opal is held between
the finger and thumb, and exposed to the rays of that luminary,
it presents but one and the same transparent colour throughout,
limited to the body of the stone: whereas the genuine opal
offers various refulgent tints in succession, and reflects now
one hue and now another, as it sheds its luminous brilliancy
upon the fingers.</p>

<p>This stone, in consequence of its extraordinary beauty, has
been called ‚Äúp√¶deros‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3059_3059"></a><a href="#Footnote_3059_3059" class="fnanchor">3059</a> by many authors; and some who make
a distinct species of it, say that it is the same as the stone that in
India is called ‚Äúsangenon.‚Äù These last-mentioned stones, it
is said, are found in Egypt also, Arabia, and, of very inferior
quality, in Pontus. Galatia, too, is said to produce them, as
also Thasos and Cyprus. The finest in quality of them have
all the beauty of opal, but they are of a softer brilliancy, and
are mostly rough on the surface. Their colour is a mixture of
sky-blue and purple, and the green hues of the smaragdus are
wanting: those, too, are preferred, which have their brilliancy
deepened by a vinous hue, rather than those which have their
colours diluted, as it were, with water.</p>

CHAP. 23.‚ÄîSARDONYX; THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT. DEFECTS
IN THE SARDONYX.</span></h3></div>

<p>Thus far we have spoken in reference to the stones, which,
it is generally agreed, belong to the highest rank; in obedience,
more particularly, to a decree<a id="FNanchor_3060_3060"></a><a href="#Footnote_3060_3060" class="fnanchor">3060</a> that has been passed by the
ladies to that effect. There is less certainty with respect to
those upon which the men as well have been left to form a
judgment; seeing that the value of each stone depends more
particularly upon the caprice of the individual and the rivalry
that exists in reference thereto; as, for example, when Claudius
C√¶sar was so much in the habit of wearing the smaragdus and
the sardonyx.<a id="FNanchor_3061_3061"></a><a href="#Footnote_3061_3061" class="fnanchor">3061</a> The first Roman who wore a sardonyx, according
to Demostratus, was the elder Africanus, since whose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">418</a></span>time this stone has been held in very high esteem at Rome: for
which reason, we shall give it the next place after the opal.
By sardonyx, as the name<a id="FNanchor_3062_3062"></a><a href="#Footnote_3062_3062" class="fnanchor">3062</a> itself indicates, was formerly understood
a sarda with a white ground beneath it, like the flesh
beneath the human finger-nail; both parts of the stone being
equally transparent. Such, according to Ismenias, Demostratus,
Zenothemis, and Sotacus, is the sardonyx of India; the last
two giving the name of ‚Äúblind‚Äù sardonyx to all the other
stones of this class which are not transparent, and which have
now entirely appropriated the name to themselves. For, at
the present day, the Arabian sardonyx presents no traces whatever
of the Indian sarda,<a id="FNanchor_3063_3063"></a><a href="#Footnote_3063_3063" class="fnanchor">3063</a> it being a stone that has been found
to be characterized by several different colours of late; black
or azure for the base, and vermilion, surrounded with a line of
rich white, for the upper part, not without a certain glimpse<a id="FNanchor_3064_3064"></a><a href="#Footnote_3064_3064" class="fnanchor">3064</a>
of purple as the white passes into the red.<a id="FNanchor_3065_3065"></a><a href="#Footnote_3065_3065" class="fnanchor">3065</a></p>

<p>We learn from Zenothemis that in his time these stones
were not held by the people of India in any high esteem, although
they are found there of so large a size as to admit of
the hilts of swords being made of them. It is well known, too,
that in that country they are exposed to view by the mountain-streams,
and that in our part of the world they were formerly
valued from the fact that they are nearly the only ones<a id="FNanchor_3066_3066"></a><a href="#Footnote_3066_3066" class="fnanchor">3066</a> among
the engraved precious stones that do not bring away the wax
when an impression is made. The consequence is, that our
example has at last taught the people of India to set a value
upon them, and the lower classes there now pierce them even,
to wear them as ornaments for the neck; the great proof, in
fact, at the present day, of a sardonyx being of Indian origin.
Those of Arabia are remarkable for their marginal line of
brilliant white, of considerable breadth, and not glistening in
hollow fissures in the stone or upon the sides, but shining upon
the very surface, at the margin, and supported by a ground
intensely black beneath. In the stones of India, this ground
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">419</a></span>is like wax in colour,<a id="FNanchor_3067_3067"></a><a href="#Footnote_3067_3067" class="fnanchor">3067</a> or else like cornel, with a circle also of
white around it. In some of these stones, too, there is a play
of colours like those of the rainbow, while the surface is redder
even than the shell of the sea-locust.<a id="FNanchor_3068_3068"></a><a href="#Footnote_3068_3068" class="fnanchor">3068</a></p>

<p>Those stones which are like honey in appearance, or of a
f√¶culent<a id="FNanchor_3069_3069"></a><a href="#Footnote_3069_3069" class="fnanchor">3069</a> colour‚Äîsuch being the name given to one defect in
them‚Äîare generally disapproved of. They are rejected also
when the white zone blends itself with the other colours, and
its limits are not definitely marked; or if, in like manner, it is
irregularly intersected by any other colour; it being looked
upon as an imperfection if the regularity of any one of the
colours is interrupted by the interposition of another. The
sardonyx of Armenia is held in some esteem, but the zone
round it is of a pallid hue.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_24"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 24.‚ÄîONYX: THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>We must give some account also of onyx,<a id="FNanchor_3070_3070"></a><a href="#Footnote_3070_3070" class="fnanchor">3070</a> because of
the name which it partly shares in common with sardonyx.
This name, though in some places<a id="FNanchor_3071_3071"></a><a href="#Footnote_3071_3071" class="fnanchor">3071</a> given to a marble, is
here used to signify a precious stone. Sudines says, that in this
stone there is a white portion which resembles the white of
the human-finger nail, in addition to the colours of chrysolithos,
sarda, and iaspis. According to Zenothemis, there are numerous
varieties of the Indian onyx, the fiery-coloured, the black, and
the cornel, with white veins encircling them, like an eye as it
were, and in some cases running across them obliquely.<a id="FNanchor_3072_3072"></a><a href="#Footnote_3072_3072" class="fnanchor">3072</a>
Sotacus mentions an Arabian onyx, which differs from the rest;
that of India, according to him, presenting small flames,<a id="FNanchor_3073_3073"></a><a href="#Footnote_3073_3073" class="fnanchor">3073</a> each
surrounded by one or more white zones; in a manner altogether
different from the Indian sardonyx, which presents a series of
white specks, while in this case it is one continuous circle.
The Arabian onyx, on the other hand, is black, he says, with a
white zone encircling it.</p>

<p>Satyrus says, that there is an onyx in India of a flesh
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">420</a></span>colour,<a id="FNanchor_3074_3074"></a><a href="#Footnote_3074_3074" class="fnanchor">3074</a> partly resembling carbunculus, and partly chrysolithos
and amethystos; a variety, however, which he altogether
disapproves of. The real onyx, according to him, has numerous
veins of variegated colours, interspersed with others of a milk-white
hue; the shades of which, as they pass into one another,
produce a tint which surpasses all description, and blends itself
into one harmonious whole, of a most beautiful appearance.</p>

<p>Not unlike sardonyx, too, is sarda,<a id="FNanchor_3075_3075"></a><a href="#Footnote_3075_3075" class="fnanchor">3075</a> a stone which also has,
in part, a kindred name with it; but before passing on to it,
we must first take some notice of all those precious stones which
have a brilliancy like that of flame.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_25"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 25. (7.)‚ÄîCARBUNCULUS: TWELVE VARIETIES OF IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the first rank among these is carbunculus,<a id="FNanchor_3076_3076"></a><a href="#Footnote_3076_3076" class="fnanchor">3076</a> so called from
its resemblance to fire; though in reality it is proof against the
action of that element:<a id="FNanchor_3077_3077"></a><a href="#Footnote_3077_3077" class="fnanchor">3077</a> hence it is that some persons call
these stones ‚Äúacaustoi.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3078_3078"></a><a href="#Footnote_3078_3078" class="fnanchor">3078</a> There are various kinds of carbunculus,
the Indian and the Garamantic, for example, which last
has been also called the Carchedonian,<a id="FNanchor_3079_3079"></a><a href="#Footnote_3079_3079" class="fnanchor">3079</a> in compliment to the
former opulence of Great Carthage.<a id="FNanchor_3080_3080"></a><a href="#Footnote_3080_3080" class="fnanchor">3080</a> To these are added the
√Üthiopian and the Alabandic stones, the latter of which are
found at Orthosia<a id="FNanchor_3081_3081"></a><a href="#Footnote_3081_3081" class="fnanchor">3081</a> in Caria, but are cut and polished at Alabanda.<a id="FNanchor_3082_3082"></a><a href="#Footnote_3082_3082" class="fnanchor">3082</a>
In addition to this, each kind is subdivided into the
male carbunculus and the female, the former of which is of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">421</a></span>more striking brilliancy, the brightness of the latter being not
so strong. In the male varieties too, we see some in which
the fire is clearer than in others; while some, again, are of a
darker<a id="FNanchor_3083_3083"></a><a href="#Footnote_3083_3083" class="fnanchor">3083</a> hue, or else have their brilliancy more deeply seated,
and shine with a more powerful lustre than others when viewed
in the sun.</p>

<p>The most highly esteemed, however, is the amethyst-coloured<a id="FNanchor_3084_3084"></a><a href="#Footnote_3084_3084" class="fnanchor">3084</a>
stone, the fire at the extremity of which closely
approaches the violet tint of amethystos: next in value to
which, are the stones known as ‚Äúsyrtites,‚Äù radiant with a
wavy, feathery,<a id="FNanchor_3085_3085"></a><a href="#Footnote_3085_3085" class="fnanchor">3085</a> refulgence. They are found more particularly,
it is said, where the reflection is most powerful of the
rays of the sun. Satyrus says that the carbunculus<a id="FNanchor_3086_3086"></a><a href="#Footnote_3086_3086" class="fnanchor">3086</a> of India
has no lustre, that it is mostly soiled, and that in all cases its
brilliancy is of a tawny complexion. The √Üthiopian stones,
he says, are dense, emit no lustre, and burn with a concentrated
flame. According to Callistratus, the refulgence of this stone
should be of a whitish hue, and, when placed upon a table, it
should heighten by its lustre other stones placed near it that
are clouded at the edge. Hence it is, that many writers speak
of this stone as the white carbunculus, while the Indian stone,
with its comparatively feeble lustre, is known by the name of
‚Äúlignyzon.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3087_3087"></a><a href="#Footnote_3087_3087" class="fnanchor">3087</a> The Carchedonian stones, they say, are of much
smaller size than the others; but those of India admit of being
hollowed out, and making vessels that will hold as much as
one sextarius<a id="FNanchor_3088_3088"></a><a href="#Footnote_3088_3088" class="fnanchor">3088</a> even.</p>

<p>According to Archela√ºs, the Carchedonian carbunculus is of
a more swarthy appearance than the others, but, when exposed
to the light of the fire or sun, and viewed obliquely, the brilliancy
of it is much more intense than that of the rest. He says,
too, that this stone, when overshadowed by a roof, has a purple
tint; that when viewed in the open air, it is of a flame colour;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">422</a></span>and that, when exposed to the rays of the sun, it scintillates.
He states also that wax, if sealed with these stones, in the
shade even, will melt. Many authors have asserted that the
Indian stones are paler than the Carchedonian, and that, quite
the converse of these last, they are all the less brilliant when
viewed obliquely; as also, that in the male Carchedonian stone
there are luminous points like stars within, while, in the case
of the female stone, the whole of its refulgence is thrown beyond
it. The stones of Alabanda too, it is said, are darker than
the other kinds, and rough on the surface. In the vicinity
also of Miletus, there are stones of this description found in the
earth, resembling those of Alabanda in colour, and proof against
the action of fire.</p>

<p>According to Theophrastus,<a id="FNanchor_3089_3089"></a><a href="#Footnote_3089_3089" class="fnanchor">3089</a> these stones are to be found also
at Orchomenus in Arcadia and in the Isle of Chios;<a id="FNanchor_3090_3090"></a><a href="#Footnote_3090_3090" class="fnanchor">3090</a> the former<a id="FNanchor_3091_3091"></a><a href="#Footnote_3091_3091" class="fnanchor">3091</a>
of which are of a darker hue, and are used for making mirrors.
He says too, that at Tr≈ìzen they are found of various colours
and mottled with white spots, those found at Corinth being
of a more pallid, whitish, hue. He states also, that they are
sometimes imported from Massilia. Bocchus informs us in his
writings, that these stones are extracted from the ground at
Olisipo;<a id="FNanchor_3092_3092"></a><a href="#Footnote_3092_3092" class="fnanchor">3092</a> at the cost of great labour, however, in consequence
of the parched, argillaceous, nature of the soil.</p>

CHAP. 26.‚ÄîDEFECTS IN CARBUNCULUS, AND THE MODE OF
TESTING IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>Nothing is more difficult than to distinguish the several
varieties of this stone, so great an opportunity do they afford
to artistic skill of compelling them to reflect the colours of
substances placed beneath. It is possible, they say, to heighten
the brilliancy of dull stones, by steeping them for fourteen
days in vinegar, this adventitious lustre being retained by them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">423</a></span>as many months. They are counterfeited, too, with great exactness
in glass; but the difference may be detected with the
touchstone; the same being the case also with other artificial
stones, as the material is always of a softer nature and comparatively
brittle. When thus tested by the stone, hard knots,
too, are detected in them; and the weight of the glass counterfeit
is always less. In some cases, too, they present small blisters
within, which shine like silver.</p>

<p>There is also a fossil stone found in Thesprotia, known as
‚Äúanthracitis,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3094_3094"></a><a href="#Footnote_3094_3094" class="fnanchor">3094</a> and resembling a burning coal<a id="FNanchor_3095_3095"></a><a href="#Footnote_3095_3095" class="fnanchor">3095</a> in appearance.
Those who have stated that it is a native also of Liguria, are
mistaken, in my opinion, unless perhaps it was to be found
there in their time. Some of these stones, they say, are surrounded
with a vein of white. Like those which we have
mentioned above, they have a fiery colour, but there is this
peculiarity in them, that when thrown into the fire they have all
the appearance of becoming quenched and deadened; while, on
the other hand, if they are drenched with water, they become
doubly glowing.<a id="FNanchor_3096_3096"></a><a href="#Footnote_3096_3096" class="fnanchor">3096</a></p>

CHAP. 28.‚ÄîSANDASTROS. SANDARESOS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Of a kindred nature, too, is sandastros,<a id="FNanchor_3097_3097"></a><a href="#Footnote_3097_3097" class="fnanchor">3097</a> known as ‚Äúgaramantites‚Äù
by some: it is found in India, at a place of that
name, and is a product also of the southern parts of Arabia.
The great recommendation of it is, that it has all the appearance
of fire placed behind a transparent substance, it burning with
star-like scintillations within, that resemble drops of gold, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">424</a></span>are always to be seen in the body of the stone, and never upon
the surface. There are certain religious associations, too, connected
with this stone, in consequence of the affinity which it
is supposed to bear with the stars; these scintillations being
mostly, in number and arrangement, like the constellations of
the Pleiades and Hyades; a circumstance which had led to the
use of it by the Chald√¶i in the ceremonials which they practise.</p>

<p>Here, too, the male stones are distinguished from the female,
by their comparative depth of colour and the vigorousness of
the tints which they impart to objects near them: indeed the
stones of India, it is said, quite dim the sight by their brilliancy.
The flame of the female sandastros is of a more softened nature,
and may be pronounced to be lustrous rather than brilliant.
Some prefer the stone of Arabia to that of India, and say that
this last bears a considerable resemblance to a smoke-coloured
chrysolithos. Ismenias asserts that sandastros, in consequence
of its extreme softness, will not admit of being polished, a
circumstance which makes it sell all<a id="FNanchor_3098_3098"></a><a href="#Footnote_3098_3098" class="fnanchor">3098</a> the dearer: other writers,
again, call these stones ‚Äúsandrisit√¶.‚Äù One point upon which
all the authorities are agreed is, that the greater the number
of stars upon the stone, the more costly it is in price.</p>

<p>The similarity of the name has sometimes caused this stone to be
confounded with that known as ‚Äúsandaresos,‚Äù and which Nicander
calls ‚Äúsandaserion,‚Äù and others ‚Äúsandaseron.‚Äù Some, again,
call this last-mentioned stone ‚Äúsandastros,‚Äù and the former one
‚Äúsandaresos.‚Äù The stone<a id="FNanchor_3099_3099"></a><a href="#Footnote_3099_3099" class="fnanchor">3099</a> that is thus mentioned by Nicander,
is a native of India as well as the other, and likewise takes
its name from the locality where it is found. The colour of
it is that of an apple, or of green oil, and no one sets any
value on it.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">425</a></span>by the light of the lamp, under which circumstances its
tints are particularly pleasing. It is found in the vicinity of
Orthosia, throughout the whole of Caria, and in the neighbouring
localities; but the most approved stones are those that
come from India. Some writers have given the name of ‚Äúdeadened‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3101_3101"></a><a href="#Footnote_3101_3101" class="fnanchor">3101</a>
carbunculus to a lychnis of second-rate quality, and

and another of a scarlet<a id="FNanchor_3103_3103"></a><a href="#Footnote_3103_3103" class="fnanchor">3103</a> tint. It is asserted, too, that these

<p>Carchedonia,<a id="FNanchor_3105_3105"></a><a href="#Footnote_3105_3105" class="fnanchor">3105</a> too, is said to have the same property, though

found in the mountains among the Nasamones,<a id="FNanchor_3106_3106"></a><a href="#Footnote_3106_3106" class="fnanchor">3106</a> being produced,
the natives think, by showers sent for the purpose from
heaven. These stones are found by the light of the moon,
more particularly when at full: in former days, Carthage was
the entrep√¥t for them. Archela√ºs speaks of a brittle variety being
found in the vicinity of Thebes also, in Egypt, full of veins,
and similar to dying embers in appearance. I find it stated,
too, that in former times, drinking-vessels used to be made of
this stone and of lychnis:<a id="FNanchor_3107_3107"></a><a href="#Footnote_3107_3107" class="fnanchor">3107</a> all these kinds of stone, however,

CHAP. 31.‚ÄîSARDA: FIVE VARIETIES OF IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>Sarda,<a id="FNanchor_3108_3108"></a><a href="#Footnote_3108_3108" class="fnanchor">3108</a> on the other hand, is remarkably useful for this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">426</a></span>purpose; a stone which shares its name, in part, with sardonyx.
It is a common stone, and was first found at Sardes, but the
most esteemed kind is that of the vicinity of Babylon. When
certain quarries are being worked, these stones are found,
adhering, like a kind of heart, to the interior of the rock. This
mineral, however, is said to be now extinct in Persia; though
it is to be found in numerous other localities, Paros and Assos,
for example.</p>

<p>In India<a id="FNanchor_3109_3109"></a><a href="#Footnote_3109_3109" class="fnanchor">3109</a> there are three varieties of this stone; the red
sarda, the one known as ‚Äúpionia,‚Äù from its thickness, and a third
kind, beneath which they place a ground of silver tinsel. The
Indian stones are transparent, those of Arabia being more
opaque. There are some found also in the vicinity of Leucas
in Epirus, and in Egypt, which have a ground placed beneath
them of leaf gold. In the case of this stone, too, the male
stone shines with a more attractive brilliancy than the female,
which is of a thicker substance, and more opaque. Among the
ancients there was no precious stone in more common use than
this; at all events, it is this stone that is made so much parade
of in the comedies of Menander and Philemon. No one, too,
among the transparent stones is tarnished more speedily by exposure
to moisture than this; though of all liquids, it is oil
that acts the most readily upon it. Those stones which are
like honey in colour, are generally disapproved of, and still
more so, when they have the complexion of earthenware.<a id="FNanchor_3110_3110"></a><a href="#Footnote_3110_3110" class="fnanchor">3110</a></p>

CHAP. 32. (8.)‚ÄîTOPAZOS: TWO VARIETIES OF IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>Topazos<a id="FNanchor_3111_3111"></a><a href="#Footnote_3111_3111" class="fnanchor">3111</a> is a stone that is still held in very high estimation
for its green tints: indeed, when it was first discovered, it was
preferred to every other kind of precious stone. It so happened
that some Troglodytic pirates, suffering from tempest and
hunger, having landed upon an island off the coast of Arabia
known as Cytis,<a id="FNanchor_3112_3112"></a><a href="#Footnote_3112_3112" class="fnanchor">3112</a> when digging there for roots and grass,
discovered this precious stone: such, at least, is the opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">427</a></span>expressed by Archela√ºs. Juba says that there is an island in the
Red Sea called ‚ÄúTopazos,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3113_3113"></a><a href="#Footnote_3113_3113" class="fnanchor">3113</a> at a distance of three hundred
stadia from the main land; that it is surrounded by fogs, and
is often sought by navigators in consequence; and that, owing
to this, it received its present name,<a id="FNanchor_3114_3114"></a><a href="#Footnote_3114_3114" class="fnanchor">3114</a> the word ‚Äútopazin‚Äù
meaning ‚Äúto seek,‚Äù in the language of the Troglodyt√¶. He
states also, that Philon, the king‚Äôs pr√¶fect, was the first to bring
these stones from this island; that, on his presenting them to
Queen Berenice, the mother of the second Ptolem√¶us, she was
wonderfully pleased with them; and that, at a later period, a
statue, four cubits in height, was made of this stone,<a id="FNanchor_3115_3115"></a><a href="#Footnote_3115_3115" class="fnanchor">3115</a> in honour
of Arsino√´, the wife of Ptolem√¶us Philadelphus, it being consecrated
in the temple known as the ‚ÄúGolden Temple.‚Äù</p>

<p>The most recent writers say that this stone is found also in
the vicinity of Alabastrum, a city of Thebais, and they distinguish
two varieties of it, the praso√Ødes<a id="FNanchor_3116_3116"></a><a href="#Footnote_3116_3116" class="fnanchor">3116</a> and the chrysopteron;<a id="FNanchor_3117_3117"></a><a href="#Footnote_3117_3117" class="fnanchor">3117</a>
which last is similar to chrysoprasus,<a id="FNanchor_3118_3118"></a><a href="#Footnote_3118_3118" class="fnanchor">3118</a> all the shades of it
tending, more or less, to resemble the colouring principle of
the leek. Topazos is the largest of all the precious stones,
and is the only one among those of high value that yields to
the action of the file, the rest being polished by the aid of
stone of Naxos.<a id="FNanchor_3119_3119"></a><a href="#Footnote_3119_3119" class="fnanchor">3119</a> It admits, too, of being worn by use.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_33"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 33.‚ÄîCALLAINA.</span></h3></div>

<p>With this stone we must also couple another, which resembles
it more closely in appearance than in value, the stone known
as ‚Äúcallaina,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3120_3120"></a><a href="#Footnote_3120_3120" class="fnanchor">3120</a> and of a pale green colour. It is found in the
countries<a id="FNanchor_3121_3121"></a><a href="#Footnote_3121_3121" class="fnanchor">3121</a> that lie at the back of India, among the Phycari,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">428</a></span>namely, who inhabit Mount Caucasus, the Sac√¶, and the
Dah√¶. It is remarkable for its size, but is covered with holes
and full of extraneous matter; that, however, which is found
in Carmania is of a finer quality, and far superior. In both
cases, however, it is only amid frozen and inaccessible rocks that
it is found, protruding from the surface, like an eye in appearance,
and slightly adhering to the rock; not as though it formed
an integral part of it, but with all the appearance of having
been attached to it. People so habituated as they are to riding
on horseback, cannot find the energy and dexterity requisite
for climbing the rocks to obtain the stones, while, at the same
time, they are quite terrified at the danger of doing so. Hence
it is, that they attack the stones with slings from a distance,
and so bring them down, moss and all. It is with this stone
that the people pay their tribute, and this the rich look upon
as their most graceful ornament for the neck.<a id="FNanchor_3122_3122"></a><a href="#Footnote_3122_3122" class="fnanchor">3122</a> This constitutes
the whole of their wealth, with some, and it is their chief
glory to recount how many of these stones they have brought
down from the mountain heights since the days of their childhood.
Their success, however, is extremely variable;<a id="FNanchor_3123_3123"></a><a href="#Footnote_3123_3123" class="fnanchor">3123</a> for while
some, at the very first throw, have brought down remarkably
fine specimens, many have arrived at old age without obtaining
any.</p>

<p>Such is the method of procuring these stones; their form
being given them by cutting, a thing that is easily effected.
The best of them have just the colour of smaragdus, a thing
that proves that the most pleasing property in them is one that
belongs of right to another stone. Their beauty is heightened
by setting them in gold, and there is no stone to which the
contrast of the gold is more becoming. The finest of them lose
their colour by coming in contact with oil, unguents, or undiluted
wine even; whereas those of a poorer quality preserve
their colour better. There is no stone, too, that is more easily
counterfeited in glass. Some writers say, that this stone is to
be found in Arabia also, in the nest of the bird known as the
‚Äúmelancoryphus.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3124_3124"></a><a href="#Footnote_3124_3124" class="fnanchor">3124</a></p>

chrysoprasus<a id="FNanchor_3127_3127"></a><a href="#Footnote_3127_3127" class="fnanchor">3127</a> is preferred, which is also similar to the colouring
matter of the leek, but varies in tint between topazos and gold.

stone that differs from the last in its dull, diminished lustre,
which, when steadily looked upon, soon fades from the sight.
Sudines says that it is to be found also in the Siberus, a river of
Attica. In appearance it resembles a smoke-coloured topazos, or,
in some cases, a topazos with a tint like honey. According to
Juba, √Üthiopia produces it, upon the shores of the river known

<p>Iaspis,<a id="FNanchor_3133_3133"></a><a href="#Footnote_3133_3133" class="fnanchor">3133</a> too, is green, and often transparent; a stone which, if
surpassed by many others, still retains the renown which it
acquired in former times. Many countries produce this stone:
that of India is like smaragdus in colour; that of Cyprus is
hard, and of a full sea-green; and that of Persia is sky-blue,
whence its name, ‚Äúa√´rizusa.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3134_3134"></a><a href="#Footnote_3134_3134" class="fnanchor">3134</a> Similar to this last is the
Caspian iaspis. On the banks of the river Thermodon the
iaspis is of an azure colour; in Phrygia, it is purple; and in
Cappadocia of an azure purple, sombre, and not refulgent.
Amisos<a id="FNanchor_3135_3135"></a><a href="#Footnote_3135_3135" class="fnanchor">3135</a> sends us an iaspis like that of India in colour, and
Chalcedon,<a id="FNanchor_3136_3136"></a><a href="#Footnote_3136_3136" class="fnanchor">3136</a> a stone of a turbid hue.</p>

<p>But it is of less consequence to distinguish the several localities
that furnish it, than it is to remark upon the degrees of
excellence which they present. The best kind is that which
has a shade of purple, the next best being the rose-coloured,
and the next the stone with the green colour of the smaragdus;
to each of which the Greeks have given names<a id="FNanchor_3137_3137"></a><a href="#Footnote_3137_3137" class="fnanchor">3137</a> according to
their respective tints. A fourth kind, which is called by them
‚Äúboria,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3138_3138"></a><a href="#Footnote_3138_3138" class="fnanchor">3138</a> resembles in colour the sky of a morning in autumn;

is an iaspis also which resembles sarda<a id="FNanchor_3140_3140"></a><a href="#Footnote_3140_3140" class="fnanchor">3140</a> in appearance, and
another with a violet tint. Not less numerous, too, are the
other kinds that are left undescribed; but they are all blue to
a fault,<a id="FNanchor_3141_3141"></a><a href="#Footnote_3141_3141" class="fnanchor">3141</a> or else resemble crystal in appearance, or the tints of
the myxa<a id="FNanchor_3142_3142"></a><a href="#Footnote_3142_3142" class="fnanchor">3142</a> plum. There is the terebenthine<a id="FNanchor_3143_3143"></a><a href="#Footnote_3143_3143" class="fnanchor">3143</a>-coloured iaspis
also; improperly so called, in my opinion, as it has all the appearance
of being a composition of numerous gems of this description.</p>

<p>The best of these stones are set in an open bezel, the gold of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">431</a></span>which only embraces the margins of the stone, leaving the
upper and lower surfaces uncovered. One great defect in
them is a subdued lustre, and a want of refulgence when
viewed from a distance. Grains also like salt appear within the
stone, and all the other defects which are common<a id="FNanchor_3144_3144"></a><a href="#Footnote_3144_3144" class="fnanchor">3144</a> to precious
stones in general. Sometimes they are imitated in glass; a fraud,
however, which may be easily detected, from the material
throwing out its refulgence, instead of concentrating it within
itself. To this class also belongs the stone called ‚Äúsphragis,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3145_3145"></a><a href="#Footnote_3145_3145" class="fnanchor">3145</a>
which is only reckoned as belonging to the domain of precious
stones, from the circumstance that it is the best of all for
making signets.<a id="FNanchor_3146_3146"></a><a href="#Footnote_3146_3146" class="fnanchor">3146</a></p>

<p>(9.) Throughout all the East, it is the custom, it is said, to
wear iaspis by way of amulet. The variety of this stone
which resembles smaragdus in colour is often found with a
white line running transversely through the middle; in which
case it is known as ‚Äúmonogrammos:‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3147_3147"></a><a href="#Footnote_3147_3147" class="fnanchor">3147</a> when it is streaked
with several lines, it is called ‚Äúpolygrammos.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3148_3148"></a><a href="#Footnote_3148_3148" class="fnanchor">3148</a> Here, too, I
may take the opportunity of exposing the falsehoods<a id="FNanchor_3149_3149"></a><a href="#Footnote_3149_3149" class="fnanchor">3149</a> of the
magicians, who pretend that this stone is beneficial for persons
when speaking in public. There is a stone also that is formed of
iaspis and onyx combined, and is known as ‚Äúiasponyx.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3150_3150"></a><a href="#Footnote_3150_3150" class="fnanchor">3150</a> Sometimes
this stone has a clouded appearance; sometimes it has
spots upon the surface like snow;<a id="FNanchor_3151_3151"></a><a href="#Footnote_3151_3151" class="fnanchor">3151</a> and sometimes it is stellated
with red spots.<a id="FNanchor_3152_3152"></a><a href="#Footnote_3152_3152" class="fnanchor">3152</a> One kind resembles salt of Megara<a id="FNanchor_3153_3153"></a><a href="#Footnote_3153_3153" class="fnanchor">3153</a> in

it had been smoked. We have seen in our day an iaspis<a id="FNanchor_3155_3155"></a><a href="#Footnote_3155_3155" class="fnanchor">3155</a>

<p>We must also give a separate account of cyanos,<a id="FNanchor_3156_3156"></a><a href="#Footnote_3156_3156" class="fnanchor">3156</a> a name
which, until very recently, was given to a species of iaspis,
on account of its c√¶rulean colour. The best kind is that of
Scythia,<a id="FNanchor_3157_3157"></a><a href="#Footnote_3157_3157" class="fnanchor">3157</a> the next best being the produce of Cyprus, and, last
of all, that of Egypt. An artificial<a id="FNanchor_3158_3158"></a><a href="#Footnote_3158_3158" class="fnanchor">3158</a> kind is much in use,
that is prepared by dyeing other substances; and this invention
is looked upon as one of the great glories of the kings
of Egypt, the name of the king who first discovered it being
still preserved in their annals. This stone, too, is divided into
male and female, and sometimes it has the appearance of being
powdered with a golden dust, in much the same way as sapphiros.</p>

also of an azure colour, though sometimes, but rarely, it is purple;
the best kind being that which comes from Media. In no
case, however, is this stone diaphanous; in addition to which,
it is not suited for engraving when intersected with hard particles
of a crystalline<a id="FNanchor_3161_3161"></a><a href="#Footnote_3161_3161" class="fnanchor">3161</a> nature. Those among them that have

CHAP. 40.‚ÄîAMETHYSTOS; FOUR VARIETIES OF IT. SOCONDION.
SAPENOS. PHARANITIS. APHRODITES BLEPHARON, ANTEROS, OR
P√ÜDEROS.</span></h3></div>

<p>We will now commence with another class of precious stones,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">433</a></span>those of a purple colour, or whose tints are derived from purple.
To the first rank belongs the amethystos<a id="FNanchor_3162_3162"></a><a href="#Footnote_3162_3162" class="fnanchor">3162</a> of India; a stone
which is also found in the part of Arabia that adjoins Syria
and is known as Petra, as also in Lesser Armenia, Egypt, and
Galatia; the very worst of all, and the least valued, being those
of Thasos and Cyprus. The name which these stones bear,
originates, it is said, in the peculiar tint of their brilliancy,
which, after closely approaching the colour of wine, passes off
into a violet without being fully pronounced; or else, according
to some authorities, in the fact that in their purple there
is something that falls short of a fiery colour, the tints fading
off and inclining to the colour of wine.</p>

<p>All these stones are transparent and of an agreeable violet
colour, and are easy<a id="FNanchor_3163_3163"></a><a href="#Footnote_3163_3163" class="fnanchor">3163</a> to engrave. Those of India have in
perfection the very richest shades of purple, and it is to attain
this colour that the dyers<a id="FNanchor_3164_3164"></a><a href="#Footnote_3164_3164" class="fnanchor">3164</a> in purple direct all their endeavours;
it presenting a fine mellowed appearance to the eye, and not
dazzling the sight, as in the case with the colours of the carbunculus.
Another variety approaches more nearly the hyacinth
in colour: the people of India call this tint ‚Äúsocon,‚Äù and the
stone itself ‚Äúsocondion.‚Äù A third stone of this class is of a
more diluted colour, and is known as ‚Äúsapenos,‚Äù being identical
with ‚Äúpharanitis,‚Äù so called from a country<a id="FNanchor_3165_3165"></a><a href="#Footnote_3165_3165" class="fnanchor">3165</a> on the
frontiers of Arabia that produces it. Of a fourth kind, the
colour is like that of wine; and in a fifth it borders very closely
upon that of crystal, the purple gradually passing off into
white. This last kind is but little valued; for a fine amethyst
should always have, when viewed sideways<a id="FNanchor_3166_3166"></a><a href="#Footnote_3166_3166" class="fnanchor">3166</a> and held up to the
light, a certain purple refulgence, like that of carbunculus,
slightly inclining to a tint of rose.</p>

<p>Some prefer giving these stones the name of ‚Äúp√¶deros‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3167_3167"></a><a href="#Footnote_3167_3167" class="fnanchor">3167</a> or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">434</a></span>of ‚Äúanteros,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3168_3168"></a><a href="#Footnote_3168_3168" class="fnanchor">3168</a> while to many they are known as ‚ÄúVenus‚Äô<a id="FNanchor_3169_3169"></a><a href="#Footnote_3169_3169" class="fnanchor">3169</a>
eyelid,‚Äù a name which would seem to be particularly appropriate
to the colour and general appearance of the gem. The
falsehoods of the magicians would persuade us that these stones
are preventive of inebriety, and that it is from this that they
have derived<a id="FNanchor_3170_3170"></a><a href="#Footnote_3170_3170" class="fnanchor">3170</a> their name. They tell us also, that if we inscribe
the names of the sun and moon upon this stone, and then
wear it suspended from the neck, with some hair of the cynocephalus<a id="FNanchor_3171_3171"></a><a href="#Footnote_3171_3171" class="fnanchor">3171</a>
and feathers of the swallow, it will act as a preservative
against all noxious spells. It is said too, that worn in any
manner, this stone will ensure access to the presence of kings;
and that it will avert hail and the attacks of locusts, if a certain
prayer is also repeated which they mention. They make similar
promises, too, in reference to the smaragdus, if graven with the
figure of an eagle or of a scarab√¶us: statements which, in my
opinion, they cannot have committed to writing without a feeling
of contempt and derision for the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>Very different from this stone is hyacinthos,<a id="FNanchor_3172_3172"></a><a href="#Footnote_3172_3172" class="fnanchor">3172</a> though partaking
of a colour that closely borders upon it. The great
difference between them is, that the brilliant violet which is
so refulgent in the amethystos, is diluted in the other stone.
Though pleasing at first sight, its beauty fades before the eye
is satiated; indeed, so far is it from satisfying the sight, that
it almost wholly fails to attract the eye, its lustre disappearing
more rapidly than the tints of the flower<a id="FNanchor_3173_3173"></a><a href="#Footnote_3173_3173" class="fnanchor">3173</a> known by the same

The stones of India are the most highly esteemed, as also those
found among the Tibareni,<a id="FNanchor_3175_3175"></a><a href="#Footnote_3175_3175" class="fnanchor">3175</a> provided these last are not of a
mottled hue. The worst in quality are those of Arabia, the
colour of them being turbid and mottled, and their brilliancy
interrupted by cloudy spots: even too, when they happen to
be limpid, they have all the appearance of being full, as it
were, of a peculiar dust. The best stones are those which,
when placed by the side of gold, impart to it a sort of whitish
hue, and so give it the appearance of silver. When this is the
case, they are set in a bezel that is open on either side; but
when the stone is of inferior quality, a ground of aurichalcum<a id="FNanchor_3176_3176"></a><a href="#Footnote_3176_3176" class="fnanchor">3176</a>
is placed beneath.</p>

<p>Though it has now altogether gone out of use for jewellery,
there is a precious stone known as ‚Äúchryselectrum,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3177_3177"></a><a href="#Footnote_3177_3177" class="fnanchor">3177</a> the colour
of which inclines to that of amber;<a id="FNanchor_3178_3178"></a><a href="#Footnote_3178_3178" class="fnanchor">3178</a> but only when viewed by
a morning<a id="FNanchor_3179_3179"></a><a href="#Footnote_3179_3179" class="fnanchor">3179</a> light. The stones of Pontus are known by their
lightness. Some of them are hard and reddish, while others,
again, are soft and of a soiled appearance. According to Bocchus,
these stones are found in Spain as well; in a spot where,
according to him, fossil crystal has been discovered, in sinking
to the water-level for wells.<a id="FNanchor_3180_3180"></a><a href="#Footnote_3180_3180" class="fnanchor">3180</a> He tells us also that he once

a stone also which resembles glass in appearance; and
another which reflects a tint like that of saffron. These stones
are imitated in glass, to such a degree of perfection, that it is
impossible to distinguish them by the eye. The touch, however,
detects the difference, the imitation being not so cold as
the real stone.</p>

<p>To this class also belongs melichrysos,<a id="FNanchor_3184_3184"></a><a href="#Footnote_3184_3184" class="fnanchor">3184</a> a stone which has
all the appearance of pure honey, seen through transparent

are very brittle, but not unpleasing to the sight. The same

<p>At the very head of the white stones is p√¶deros;<a id="FNanchor_3186_3186"></a><a href="#Footnote_3186_3186" class="fnanchor">3186</a> though
it may still be questionable to which of the colours it in
reality belongs. As to the name, it has been so much bandied
about among other precious stones of conspicuous beauty, that
it has quite assumed the privilege of being a synonymous
term<a id="FNanchor_3187_3187"></a><a href="#Footnote_3187_3187" class="fnanchor">3187</a> for all that is charming to the eye. Still, however, there
is one<a id="FNanchor_3188_3188"></a><a href="#Footnote_3188_3188" class="fnanchor">3188</a> stone in particular which fully merits all the commendation
that might be expected for a stone with so prepossessing
a name: for in itself it reunites the transparency of crystal,
the peculiar green of the sky, the deep tints of purple,
and a sort of bright reflex, like that of a golden-coloured
wine; a reflex, indeed, that is always the last to meet
the eye, but is always crowned with the lustrous hues of
purple. The stone, in fact, has all the appearance of having
been bathed in each of these tints, individually, and yet in the
whole of them at once. There is no precious stone either that
has a clearer water than this, or that presents a more pleasing
sweetness to the eye.</p>

<p>P√¶deros of the finest quality comes from India, where it is
known as ‚Äúsangenon;‚Äù the next best being that of Egypt,
called ‚Äútenites.‚Äù That of third-rate quality is found in Arabia,
but it is rough upon the surface. Next, we have the stone of
Pontus, the radiance of which is softer than in that of Thasos,
which, in its turn, is of a more mellowed colour than the
stones of Galatia, Thrace, and Cyprus. The defects commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">437</a></span>found in these stones are, a want of brilliancy, a confusion
with colours which do not properly belong to them, and the
other imperfections which are found in stones in general.<a id="FNanchor_3189_3189"></a><a href="#Footnote_3189_3189" class="fnanchor">3189</a></p>

holds its high rank on account of a certain peculiarity in its
nature, it having a light enclosed within, in the pupil of an
eye as it were. This light, which has all the appearance of
moving within the stone, it transmits according to the angle of
inclination at which it is held; now in one direction, and
now in another. When held facing the sun, it emits white
rays like those of a star, and to this, in fact, it owes its name.<a id="FNanchor_3191_3191"></a><a href="#Footnote_3191_3191" class="fnanchor">3191</a>

<p>Of a similar white radiance is the stone that is known as
‚Äúastrion,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3192_3192"></a><a href="#Footnote_3192_3192" class="fnanchor">3192</a> closely resembling crystal in its nature, and found

there shines internally a brilliant star, with a refulgence like
that of the moon when full. Some will have it that this stone
receives its name from the fact that, when held opposite to the
stars, it absorbs the light they emit and then returns it. The
finest stones, they say, are those of Carmania, there being
none more entirely free from all defects. They add, also, that
a stone of inferior quality is known as ‚Äúceraunia,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3194_3194"></a><a href="#Footnote_3194_3194" class="fnanchor">3194</a> and that,

<p>Among the white stones also, there is one known as
‚Äúceraunia,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3197_3197"></a><a href="#Footnote_3197_3197" class="fnanchor">3197</a> which absorbs the brilliancy of the stars. It is
of a crystalline formation, of a lustrous azure colour, and is a
native of Carmania. Zenothemis admits that it is white, but
asserts that it has the figure of a blazing star within. Some of
them, he says, are dull, in which case it is the custom to steep
them for some days in a mixture of nitre and vinegar; at the
end of which period the star makes its appearance, but gradually
dies away by the end of as many months.</p>

<p>Sotacus mentions also two other varieties of ceraunia, one
black and the other red; and he says that they resemble axes
in shape. Those which are black and round,<a id="FNanchor_3198_3198"></a><a href="#Footnote_3198_3198" class="fnanchor">3198</a> he says, are
looked upon as sacred, and by their assistance cities and fleets

CHAP. 52.‚ÄîIRIS; TWO VARIETIES OF IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>The next name mentioned by these authors is that of the
stone called ‚Äúiris;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3201_3201"></a><a href="#Footnote_3201_3201" class="fnanchor">3201</a> which is found, in a fossil state, in a
certain island of the Red Sea, forty miles distant from the city
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">439</a></span>of Berenice. It is partly composed of crystal, and hence it is
that some have called it ‚Äúroot of crystal.‚Äù It takes its name
‚Äúiris‚Äù from the properties which it possesses; for, when
struck by the rays of the sun in a covered spot, it projects upon
the nearest walls the form and diversified colours of the rainbow;
continually changing its tints, and exciting admiration
by the great variety of colours which it presents. That it is
hexahedral in form, like crystal, is generally agreed; but some
say that it is rough on the sides and of unequal angles;
and that, when exposed to a full sun, it disperses the rays
that are thrown upon it, while at the same time, by throwing
out a certain brightness<a id="FNanchor_3202_3202"></a><a href="#Footnote_3202_3202" class="fnanchor">3202</a> before it, it illumines all objects
that may happen to be adjacent. The stone, however,
as already stated, only presents these colours when under
cover; not as though they were in the body of the stone
itself, but, to all appearance, as if they were the result of the
reflected light upon the surface of the wall. The best kind is
the one that produces the largest arcs, with the closest resemblance
to the rainbow.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIritis‚Äù is the name of another stone, similar to the last in
all other respects, but remarkable for its extreme hardness.
Horus says, in his writings, that this stone, calcined and triturated,
is a remedy for the bite of the ichneumon, and that it is
a native of Persia.</p>

<p>Having now described the principal precious stones, classified
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">440</a></span>according to their respective colours, I shall proceed to mention
the rest of them in their alphabetical order.</p>

<p>(10.) Achates<a id="FNanchor_3204_3204"></a><a href="#Footnote_3204_3204" class="fnanchor">3204</a> was a stone formerly in high esteem, but
now held in none. It was first found in Sicily, near a river
of that name; but has since been discovered in numerous other
localities. In size it exceeds any other stones of this class,
and the varieties of it are numerous, the name varying accordingly.
Thus, for example, we have iaspachates,<a id="FNanchor_3205_3205"></a><a href="#Footnote_3205_3205" class="fnanchor">3205</a> cerachates,<a id="FNanchor_3206_3206"></a><a href="#Footnote_3206_3206" class="fnanchor">3206</a>
smaragdachates,<a id="FNanchor_3207_3207"></a><a href="#Footnote_3207_3207" class="fnanchor">3207</a> h√¶machates,<a id="FNanchor_3208_3208"></a><a href="#Footnote_3208_3208" class="fnanchor">3208</a> leucachates,<a id="FNanchor_3209_3209"></a><a href="#Footnote_3209_3209" class="fnanchor">3209</a> dendrachates,<a id="FNanchor_3210_3210"></a><a href="#Footnote_3210_3210" class="fnanchor">3210</a>
marked with small shrubs, as it were; autachates,<a id="FNanchor_3211_3211"></a><a href="#Footnote_3211_3211" class="fnanchor">3211</a> which when
burnt has a smell like that of myrrh; and coralloachates,<a id="FNanchor_3212_3212"></a><a href="#Footnote_3212_3212" class="fnanchor">3212</a>
spotted all over, like sapphiros, with drops of gold, and commonly
found in Crete, where it is also known as ‚Äúsacred‚Äù
achates. This last, it is thought, is good for wounds inflicted
by spiders and scorpions; a property which I could really
believe to belong to the stones of Sicily, for, the moment they
breathe the air of that province, scorpions lose their venom.</p>

<p>The stones, too, that are found in India are possessed of
similar properties, and of other great and marvellous properties
as well; for they present the appearance in them of rivers,<a id="FNanchor_3213_3213"></a><a href="#Footnote_3213_3213" class="fnanchor">3213</a>
woods,<a id="FNanchor_3214_3214"></a><a href="#Footnote_3214_3214" class="fnanchor">3214</a> beasts of burden, and forms even, like ivy<a id="FNanchor_3215_3215"></a><a href="#Footnote_3215_3215" class="fnanchor">3215</a> and the
trappings of horses. Medical men, too, make grinding-hones<a id="FNanchor_3216_3216"></a><a href="#Footnote_3216_3216" class="fnanchor">3216</a>
of these stones, and indeed the very sight of them is beneficial
for the eyes: held in the mouth, they allay thirst. Those
found in Phrygia have no green in them, and those of Thebes
in Egypt are destitute of red and white veins. These last are
good as a counterpoison to the venom of the scorpion, and the
stones of Cyprus are held in similar repute. Some persons set
the highest value upon those stones which present a transparency
like that of glass. They are found also in Trachinia,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">441</a></span>in the vicinity of Mount ≈íta, upon Mount Parnassus, in the
Isle of Lesbos, in Messene, where they resemble the flowers
that grow in the hedges, and at Rhodes.</p>

<p>The magicians make other distinctions in reference to these
stones: those, they tell us, which have spots upon them like
the spots on the lion‚Äôs skin, are efficacious as a protection against
scorpions; and in Persia, they say, these stones are used, by
way of fumigation, for arresting tempests and hurricanes, and
for stopping the course of rivers, the proof of their efficacy
being their turning the water cold, if thrown into a boiling
cauldron. To be duly efficacious, they must be attached to the
body with hairs from a lion‚Äôs mane. The hair, however, of
the hy√¶na is held in abomination for this purpose, as being a
promoter of discord in families. The stone that is of an uniform
colour renders athletes invincible, they say: the way of
testing it is to throw it, along with colouring matter, into a
pot full of oil; after being kept for a couple of hours gently on
the boil, if genuine, it will impart an uniform colour of vermilion
to the mixture.</p>

<p>Acopos<a id="FNanchor_3217_3217"></a><a href="#Footnote_3217_3217" class="fnanchor">3217</a> is a stone like nitre<a id="FNanchor_3218_3218"></a><a href="#Footnote_3218_3218" class="fnanchor">3218</a> in appearance, porous, and
starred with drops of gold: gently boiled with oil and applied
as an unguent, it relieves lassitude, if we choose to believe it.
Alabastritis<a id="FNanchor_3219_3219"></a><a href="#Footnote_3219_3219" class="fnanchor">3219</a> is a stone which comes from Alabastron in
Egypt and Damascus in Syria: it is of a white colour, spotted
with various other tints. Calcined with fossil salt and pulverized,
it is a cure for affections of the mouth and teeth, it is
said. Alectoria<a id="FNanchor_3220_3220"></a><a href="#Footnote_3220_3220" class="fnanchor">3220</a> is the name given to a stone that is found in
the crop of poultry, like crystal in appearance, and about as
large as a bean in size: Milo<a id="FNanchor_3221_3221"></a><a href="#Footnote_3221_3221" class="fnanchor">3221</a> of Crotona, some will have it,
was thought to be in the habit of carrying this stone about
him, a thing that rendered him invincible in his athletic contests.
Androdamas<a id="FNanchor_3222_3222"></a><a href="#Footnote_3222_3222" class="fnanchor">3222</a> has the shining colour of silver, like
adamas;<a id="FNanchor_3223_3223"></a><a href="#Footnote_3223_3223" class="fnanchor">3223</a> it is always quadrangular, like small cubes in shape.
The magicians are of opinion that it was thus named from the
fact that it subdues anger and violence in man. Whether
argyrodamas<a id="FNanchor_3224_3224"></a><a href="#Footnote_3224_3224" class="fnanchor">3224</a> is the same stone or not, authors do not inform
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">442</a></span>us. Antipathes<a id="FNanchor_3225_3225"></a><a href="#Footnote_3225_3225" class="fnanchor">3225</a> is a black stone, and not transparent: the mode
of testing it, is by boiling it in milk, to which, if genuine, it
imparts a colour like that of myrrh. A person might probably
expect to find some extraordinary virtues in this stone, seeing
that, among so many other substances possessed of antipathetic
properties, it is the only one that bears this name. The magicians
will have it that it possesses the power of counteracting
fascinations.</p>

<p>Arabica<a id="FNanchor_3226_3226"></a><a href="#Footnote_3226_3226" class="fnanchor">3226</a> is a stone which closely resembles ivory in appearance,
and, indeed, might easily be taken for it, were it not
for its superior hardness: persons who have this stone about
them, it is thought, will experience a cure of diseases of the
sinews. Aromatitis,<a id="FNanchor_3227_3227"></a><a href="#Footnote_3227_3227" class="fnanchor">3227</a> too, is a stone that is found in Arabia, as
also in the vicinity of Phir√¶ in Egypt: it is always full of
small stones, and like myrrh in colour and smell, a thing that
makes it much in request with ladies of rank.<a id="FNanchor_3228_3228"></a><a href="#Footnote_3228_3228" class="fnanchor">3228</a> Asbestos<a id="FNanchor_3229_3229"></a><a href="#Footnote_3229_3229" class="fnanchor">3229</a>
is found in the mountains of Arcadia, and is of an iron
colour. Democritus informs us that aspisatis<a id="FNanchor_3230_3230"></a><a href="#Footnote_3230_3230" class="fnanchor">3230</a> is a native
of Arabia, that it is of a fiery colour, and that patients
should wear it attached to the body with camels‚Äô dung; he
says, too, that it is found in the nests of certain birds<a id="FNanchor_3231_3231"></a><a href="#Footnote_3231_3231" class="fnanchor">3231</a> in
Arabia. The same writer also mentions another stone of this
name, that is found at Leucopetra in the same country, of a
silver colour, radiant, and an excellent preservative against
delirium. In India, he says, and on Mount Acidane in
Persia, there is a stone found that is known as ‚Äúatizo√´,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3232_3232"></a><a href="#Footnote_3232_3232" class="fnanchor">3232</a> of a
silver lustre, three fingers in length, like a lentil in shape,
possessed of a pleasant smell, and considered necessary by the
Magi at the consecration of a king. Augetis<a id="FNanchor_3233_3233"></a><a href="#Footnote_3233_3233" class="fnanchor">3233</a> is thought by
many to be identical with callaina.<a id="FNanchor_3234_3234"></a><a href="#Footnote_3234_3234" class="fnanchor">3234</a> Amphidanes,<a id="FNanchor_3235_3235"></a><a href="#Footnote_3235_3235" class="fnanchor">3235</a> which is
also known as ‚Äúchrysocolla,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3236_3236"></a><a href="#Footnote_3236_3236" class="fnanchor">3236</a> is a stone found in that part of
India where the ants<a id="FNanchor_3237_3237"></a><a href="#Footnote_3237_3237" class="fnanchor">3237</a> throw up gold, and in it there are certain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">443</a></span>square pieces, like gold in appearance. The nature of this
stone, it is asserted, is similar to that of the magnet; in addition
to which, it is said to have the property of increasing gold.</p>

<p>Aphrodisiaca<a id="FNanchor_3238_3238"></a><a href="#Footnote_3238_3238" class="fnanchor">3238</a> is a stone of a reddish white colour. Apsyctos,<a id="FNanchor_3239_3239"></a><a href="#Footnote_3239_3239" class="fnanchor">3239</a>
when heated by fire, retains the warmth so long as
seven days; it is black and ponderous, and is streaked with
red veins. It is good too, it is thought, as a preservative
against cold. According to Iacchus, √Ügyptilla<a id="FNanchor_3240_3240"></a><a href="#Footnote_3240_3240" class="fnanchor">3240</a> is a kind of
white and black sarda, intersected with veins; but the stone
commonly known by that name is black at the lower part, and
azure on the surface. It takes its name from the country that
produces it.</p>

<p>Of balanites<a id="FNanchor_3241_3241"></a><a href="#Footnote_3241_3241" class="fnanchor">3241</a> there are two kinds, the one of a greenish hue,
and the other like Corinthian bronze in appearance; the former
comes from Coptos, and the latter from Troglodytica. They
are both of them intersected by a flame-like vein, which runs
through the middle. Coptos, too, sends us batrachitis;<a id="FNanchor_3242_3242"></a><a href="#Footnote_3242_3242" class="fnanchor">3242</a> one
kind of which is like a frog in colour, another has the tint of
ebony, and a third is blackish inclining to red. Baptes<a id="FNanchor_3243_3243"></a><a href="#Footnote_3243_3243" class="fnanchor">3243</a> is a
soft stone, and of a most excellent smell. Beli oculus<a id="FNanchor_3244_3244"></a><a href="#Footnote_3244_3244" class="fnanchor">3244</a> is a
stone of a whitish hue, surrounding a black pupil in the middle,
which shines amid a lustre like that of gold. This stone, in
consequence of its singular beauty, has been consecrated to the
deity<a id="FNanchor_3245_3245"></a><a href="#Footnote_3245_3245" class="fnanchor">3245</a> held in the highest veneration by the people of Assyria.
According to Democritus, there is also a stone called belus,
and found at Arbela; it is about the size of a walnut, and
looks<a id="FNanchor_3246_3246"></a><a href="#Footnote_3246_3246" class="fnanchor">3246</a> like glass. Baroptenus or barippe is black, and covered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">444</a></span>with knots of a white and blood-red colour: the use of it as
an amulet is avoided, as being apt to produce monstrosities.</p>

<p>Botryitis<a id="FNanchor_3247_3247"></a><a href="#Footnote_3247_3247" class="fnanchor">3247</a> is sometimes black and sometimes purple-red,<a id="FNanchor_3248_3248"></a><a href="#Footnote_3248_3248" class="fnanchor">3248</a>
and resembles a bunch of grapes<a id="FNanchor_3249_3249"></a><a href="#Footnote_3249_3249" class="fnanchor">3249</a> in form, when making its
first appearance. Zoroaster says, that bostrychitis<a id="FNanchor_3250_3250"></a><a href="#Footnote_3250_3250" class="fnanchor">3250</a> is a stone
which is more like the hair of females than anything else.
Bucardia<a id="FNanchor_3251_3251"></a><a href="#Footnote_3251_3251" class="fnanchor">3251</a> resembles an ox-heart in appearance, and is only
found at Babylon. Brontea<a id="FNanchor_3252_3252"></a><a href="#Footnote_3252_3252" class="fnanchor">3252</a> is a stone like the head of a
tortoise, which falls with thunder, it is supposed: if too, we
are to believe what is said, it has the property of quenching
the fire in objects that have been struck by lightning. Bolos<a id="FNanchor_3253_3253"></a><a href="#Footnote_3253_3253" class="fnanchor">3253</a>
is the name of a stone found in Iberia,<a id="FNanchor_3254_3254"></a><a href="#Footnote_3254_3254" class="fnanchor">3254</a> similar to a clod of
earth in appearance.</p>

<p>Cadmitis differs only from the stone that is known as
ostracitis<a id="FNanchor_3255_3255"></a><a href="#Footnote_3255_3255" class="fnanchor">3255</a> in being sometimes surrounded with blisters of an
azure colour. Callais<a id="FNanchor_3256_3256"></a><a href="#Footnote_3256_3256" class="fnanchor">3256</a> is like sapphiros<a id="FNanchor_3257_3257"></a><a href="#Footnote_3257_3257" class="fnanchor">3257</a> in colour, only
that it is paler and more closely resembles the tint of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">445</a></span>water near the sea-shore in appearance. Capnitis,<a id="FNanchor_3258_3258"></a><a href="#Footnote_3258_3258" class="fnanchor">3258</a> in the
opinion of some, is a peculiar species of stone: it is covered
with numerous spiral streaks, of a smoky colour, as already<a id="FNanchor_3259_3259"></a><a href="#Footnote_3259_3259" class="fnanchor">3259</a>
stated in the appropriate place. Cappadocia<a id="FNanchor_3260_3260"></a><a href="#Footnote_3260_3260" class="fnanchor">3260</a> is a native of
Phrygia, and resembles ivory in appearance. Callaica<a id="FNanchor_3261_3261"></a><a href="#Footnote_3261_3261" class="fnanchor">3261</a> is
the name given to a stone like a clouded callaina;<a id="FNanchor_3262_3262"></a><a href="#Footnote_3262_3262" class="fnanchor">3262</a> a number
of them are always found united, it is said. Catochitis<a id="FNanchor_3263_3263"></a><a href="#Footnote_3263_3263" class="fnanchor">3263</a> is a
stone found in Corsica, of larger size than the other precious
stones; and of a more wonderful nature, if the story is true,
that it retains the hand like gum, when placed upon it. Catoptritis<a id="FNanchor_3264_3264"></a><a href="#Footnote_3264_3264" class="fnanchor">3264</a>
is found in Cappadocia, and, from its whiteness, reflects
figures like a mirror. Cepitis<a id="FNanchor_3265_3265"></a><a href="#Footnote_3265_3265" class="fnanchor">3265</a> or cepolatitis is a white stone,
with veins upon it uniting together. Ceramitis<a id="FNanchor_3266_3266"></a><a href="#Footnote_3266_3266" class="fnanchor">3266</a> has a colour
like that of earthenware.</p>

<p>Cin√¶dia<a id="FNanchor_3267_3267"></a><a href="#Footnote_3267_3267" class="fnanchor">3267</a> is a stone found in the brain of a fish<a id="FNanchor_3268_3268"></a><a href="#Footnote_3268_3268" class="fnanchor">3268</a> of a corresponding
name. It is white and oblong, and possessed of marvellous
virtues, if we are to put faith in what is said, that it
announces before-hand whether the sea will be tranquil or
stormy.<a id="FNanchor_3269_3269"></a><a href="#Footnote_3269_3269" class="fnanchor">3269</a> Ceritis<a id="FNanchor_3270_3270"></a><a href="#Footnote_3270_3270" class="fnanchor">3270</a> is a stone like wax: circos<a id="FNanchor_3271_3271"></a><a href="#Footnote_3271_3271" class="fnanchor">3271</a> resembles the
plumage of the hawk: corsoides<a id="FNanchor_3272_3272"></a><a href="#Footnote_3272_3272" class="fnanchor">3272</a> is like white hair in appearance.
Coralloachates<a id="FNanchor_3273_3273"></a><a href="#Footnote_3273_3273" class="fnanchor">3273</a> is very similar to coral, marked with
drops of gold; and corallis, a native of India and Syene, resembles
minium<a id="FNanchor_3274_3274"></a><a href="#Footnote_3274_3274" class="fnanchor">3274</a> in appearance. Crateritis<a id="FNanchor_3275_3275"></a><a href="#Footnote_3275_3275" class="fnanchor">3275</a> is in colour a
medium between chrysolithos<a id="FNanchor_3276_3276"></a><a href="#Footnote_3276_3276" class="fnanchor">3276</a> and amber, and is remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446">446</a></span>for its hardness. Crocallis<a id="FNanchor_3277_3277"></a><a href="#Footnote_3277_3277" class="fnanchor">3277</a> is a gem like the cherry in its
tints. Cyitis<a id="FNanchor_3278_3278"></a><a href="#Footnote_3278_3278" class="fnanchor">3278</a> is a stone found in the vicinity of Coptos; it is
white, and to all appearance has an embryo stone within,
the rattling of which may be heard on shaking it. Chalcophonos<a id="FNanchor_3279_3279"></a><a href="#Footnote_3279_3279" class="fnanchor">3279</a>
is a black stone, but when struck it clinks like brass:
tragic actors are recommended to carry it about them. Of
chelidonia<a id="FNanchor_3280_3280"></a><a href="#Footnote_3280_3280" class="fnanchor">3280</a> there are two varieties, both resembling the swallow
in colour: one of them is purple on one side, and the
other is purple besprinkled with black spots. Chelonia<a id="FNanchor_3281_3281"></a><a href="#Footnote_3281_3281" class="fnanchor">3281</a> is the
eye of the Indian tortoise, and is the most marvellous of all the
stones, if we believe the lying stories told by the magicians.
For, according to them, this stone, placed upon the tongue after
rinsing the mouth with honey, will ensure power of divination,
if this is done at full moon or new moon, for one whole
day. If, however, this plan is adopted while the moon is on
the increase, the power of divination will be acquired before
sun-rise only, and if upon other days, from the first<a id="FNanchor_3282_3282"></a><a href="#Footnote_3282_3282" class="fnanchor">3282</a> hour to
the sixth.</p>

<p>Chelonitis,<a id="FNanchor_3283_3283"></a><a href="#Footnote_3283_3283" class="fnanchor">3283</a> too, is a stone that resembles the tortoise<a id="FNanchor_3284_3284"></a><a href="#Footnote_3284_3284" class="fnanchor">3284</a> in
appearance, and the many virtues of which are talked of for
calming storms and tempests. As to the one that has all the
appearance of being sprinkled with spots of gold, if thrown
with a scarab√¶us into boiling water, it will raise a tempest,
they say. Chloritis<a id="FNanchor_3285_3285"></a><a href="#Footnote_3285_3285" class="fnanchor">3285</a> is a stone of a grass-green colour: according
to the magicians, it is found in the crop of the motacilla,<a id="FNanchor_3286_3286"></a><a href="#Footnote_3286_3286" class="fnanchor">3286</a>
being engendered with the bird. They recommend
also that it should be set in iron, for the purpose of working
certain portentous marvels which they promise, as usual.
Choaspitis is a stone so called from the river Choaspes,<a id="FNanchor_3287_3287"></a><a href="#Footnote_3287_3287" class="fnanchor">3287</a> of a
brilliant, golden colour mixed with green. Chrysolampis<a id="FNanchor_3288_3288"></a><a href="#Footnote_3288_3288" class="fnanchor">3288</a> is a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">447</a></span>native of √Üthiopia, and is pale by day, but of a fiery lustre by
night. Chrysopis<a id="FNanchor_3289_3289"></a><a href="#Footnote_3289_3289" class="fnanchor">3289</a> has all the appearance of gold.<a id="FNanchor_3290_3290"></a><a href="#Footnote_3290_3290" class="fnanchor">3290</a> Ceponides<a id="FNanchor_3291_3291"></a><a href="#Footnote_3291_3291" class="fnanchor">3291</a>
is found at Atarna, a borough, and once a city, of √Üolis. It
is transparent, presents numerous tints, and has sometimes the
appearance of glass, sometimes of crystal, and sometimes of
iaspis. Indeed, the stones of this kind that are tarnished even,
are possessed of such singular brilliancy as to reflect objects
like a mirror.</p>

Diadochos<a id="FNanchor_3293_3293"></a><a href="#Footnote_3293_3293" class="fnanchor">3293</a> is a stone that resembles the beryl. Of diphyes<a id="FNanchor_3294_3294"></a><a href="#Footnote_3294_3294" class="fnanchor">3294</a>
there are two kinds, the white and the black, male and female,

is hard and black, and covered with red spots. Triturated in
water, this stone imparts to it the flavour of wine, and it is
generally thought to be a preservative against intoxication.
Draconitis<a id="FNanchor_3296_3296"></a><a href="#Footnote_3296_3296" class="fnanchor">3296</a> or dracontia is a stone produced from the brain of
the dragon;<a id="FNanchor_3297_3297"></a><a href="#Footnote_3297_3297" class="fnanchor">3297</a> but unless the head of the animal is cut off
while it is alive, the stone will not assume the form of a gem,
through spite on the part of the serpent, when finding itself at
the point of death: hence it is that, for this purpose, the head
is cut off when it is asleep.<a id="FNanchor_3298_3298"></a><a href="#Footnote_3298_3298" class="fnanchor">3298</a></p>

<p>Sotacus, who tells us that he once saw a stone of this kind in
the possession of a king, says that persons go in search of it in
a chariot drawn by two horses; and that, the moment they see
the serpent, they strew narcotic drugs in its way, and then cut
off its head when asleep. According to him, this stone is
white and pellucid, and admits of no polishing or engraving.</p>

produces saliva, and it dissolves when put into the mouth.
They say, too, that it deprives persons of their memory: it is

<p>Heliotropium<a id="FNanchor_3328_3328"></a><a href="#Footnote_3328_3328" class="fnanchor">3328</a> is found in √Üthiopia, Africa, and Cyprus:

has been thus named,<a id="FNanchor_3329_3329"></a><a href="#Footnote_3329_3329" class="fnanchor">3329</a> from the circumstance that, if placed
in a vessel of water and exposed to the full light of the sun,
it changes to a reflected colour like that of blood; this being
the case with the stone of √Üthiopia more particularly. Out
of the water, too, it reflects the figure of the sun like a mirror,
and it discovers eclipses of that luminary by showing the
moon passing over its disk. In the use of this stone, also, we
have a most glaring illustration of the impudent effrontery
of the adepts in magic, for they say that, if it is combined with
the plant<a id="FNanchor_3330_3330"></a><a href="#Footnote_3330_3330" class="fnanchor">3330</a> heliotropium, and certain incantations are then repeated
over it, it will render the person invisible who carries
it about him.</p>

<p>Heph√¶stitis<a id="FNanchor_3331_3331"></a><a href="#Footnote_3331_3331" class="fnanchor">3331</a> also, though a radiant stone, partakes of the
properties of a mirror in reflecting objects. The mode of
testing it is to put it into boiling water, which should immediately
become cold. If exposed to the rays of the sun, it
should instantly cause dry fuel to ignite:<a id="FNanchor_3332_3332"></a><a href="#Footnote_3332_3332" class="fnanchor">3332</a> Corycus<a id="FNanchor_3333_3333"></a><a href="#Footnote_3333_3333" class="fnanchor">3333</a> is the

a pallid hue, with a circle surrounding it of a golden colour.
Hexecontalithos<a id="FNanchor_3335_3335"></a><a href="#Footnote_3335_3335" class="fnanchor">3335</a> receives its name from the numerous variety

Hammitis<a id="FNanchor_3338_3338"></a><a href="#Footnote_3338_3338" class="fnanchor">3338</a> is similar in appearance to the spawn of fish: there

composed of nitre,<a id="FNanchor_3339_3339"></a><a href="#Footnote_3339_3339" class="fnanchor">3339</a> except that it is remarkably hard. Hammonis
cornu<a id="FNanchor_3340_3340"></a><a href="#Footnote_3340_3340" class="fnanchor">3340</a> is reckoned among the most sacred gems of

<p>Hormiscion<a id="FNanchor_3341_3341"></a><a href="#Footnote_3341_3341" class="fnanchor">3341</a> is one of the most pleasing stones to the sight;

extremity with a whitish light. Hy√¶nia<a id="FNanchor_3342_3342"></a><a href="#Footnote_3342_3342" class="fnanchor">3342</a> is derived from the
eyes of the hy√¶na, it is said, the animal being hunted to obtain
it; placed beneath the tongue, if we believe the story,
it will enable a person to prophesy the future. H√¶matitis,<a id="FNanchor_3343_3343"></a><a href="#Footnote_3343_3343" class="fnanchor">3343</a>
of the very finest quality, comes from  √Üthiopia, but it is found
in Arabia and Africa as well. It is a stone of a blood-red
colour, and we must not omit to mention the assurance given
[by the magicians], that the possession of it reveals treacherous
designs on the part of the barbarians. Zachalias of Babylon,
in the books which he dedicated to King Mithridates, attributing
the destinies of man to certain properties innate in
precious stones, is not content with vaunting the merits of this
stone as curative of diseases of the eyes and liver, but recommends
it also as ensuring success to petitions addressed to
kings. He also makes it play its part in lawsuits and judgments,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">452</a></span>and even goes so far as to say that it is highly beneficial
to be rubbed with it on the field of battle. There is another
stone of the same class, called ‚Äúmenui‚Äù by the people of
India, and ‚Äúxanthos‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3344_3344"></a><a href="#Footnote_3344_3344" class="fnanchor">3344</a> by the Greeks: it is of a whitish, tawny

with a reflected colour like that of honey. It has a figure
within it like that of the moon, and reflects the face of that
luminary, if what we are told is true, according to its phases,

this stone is a native of Arabia, it is thought. Sideritis<a id="FNanchor_3409_3409"></a><a href="#Footnote_3409_3409" class="fnanchor">3409</a> is a

<p>New species of precious stones are repeatedly brought into
existence, and fresh ones are found all at once, destitute of
names. Thus, for example, there was a stone formerly discovered
in the gold-mines of Lampsacus, which, on account of
its extraordinary beauty, was sent to King Alexander, as we
learn from Theophrastus.<a id="FNanchor_3461_3461"></a><a href="#Footnote_3461_3461" class="fnanchor">3461</a> Cochlides,<a id="FNanchor_3462_3462"></a><a href="#Footnote_3462_3462" class="fnanchor">3462</a> too, which are now so
common, are rather artificial productions than natural, and in
Arabia there have been found vast masses of them; which are
boiled, it is said, in honey, for seven days and nights without
intermission. By doing this, all earthy and faulty particles
are removed; after which, the mass, thus cleansed and purified,
is adorned by the ingenuity of artists with variegated veins and
spots, and cut into such shapes as may be most to the taste of
purchasers. Indeed, these articles, in former times, were made
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">462</a></span>of so large a size, that they were employed in the East as
frontals for the horses of kings, and as pendants for their trappings.<a id="FNanchor_3463_3463"></a><a href="#Footnote_3463_3463" class="fnanchor">3463</a></p>

<p>All precious stones in general are improved in brilliancy by
being boiled in honey, Corsican honey more particularly; but
acrid substances are in every respect injurious to them. As
to the stones which are variegated, and to which new colours
are imparted by the inventive ingenuity of man, as they have
no name in common use, they are usually known by that of
‚Äúphysis;‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_3464_3464"></a><a href="#Footnote_3464_3464" class="fnanchor">3464</a> a name which claims for them, as it were, that admiration
which we are more ready to bestow upon the works
of Nature. But really, these artificial stones have names
without end, and I could never think of recounting the infinite
series of them, coined as they have been by the frivolous tendencies
of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Having already described the more noble gems, and indeed
those of inferior quality which are found among the stones that
are held in high esteem, I must content myself with knowing
that I have pointed out those kinds which are the most deserving
of mention. It will be as well, however, for the reader to
bear in mind, that, according to the varying number of the
spots and inequalities on their surface, according to the numerous
intersections of lines and their multiplied tints and shades,
the names of precious stones are subject to repeated changes;
the material itself, for the most part, remaining just the same.</p>

CHAP. 75.‚ÄîTHE VARIOUS FORMS OF PRECIOUS STONES.</span></h3></div>

<p>We will now make some observations in reference to precious
stones in general, following therein the opinions that
have been expressed by various authors. Stones with a level
surface are preferred to those which are concave or protuberant
on the face. An oblong shape is the one that is most approved
of, and, next to that, the lenticular<a id="FNanchor_3465_3465"></a><a href="#Footnote_3465_3465" class="fnanchor">3465</a> form, as it is called. After
this, the stone with a plane surface and circular is admired,
those which are angular being held in the least esteem. There
is considerable difficulty in distinguishing genuine stones from
false; the more so, as there has been discovered a method of
transforming genuine stones of one kind into false stones of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463">463</a></span>another.<a id="FNanchor_3466_3466"></a><a href="#Footnote_3466_3466" class="fnanchor">3466</a> Sardonyx, for example, is imitated by cementing
together three other precious stones, in such a way that no
skill can detect the fraud; a black stone being used for the
purpose, a white stone, and one of a vermilion<a id="FNanchor_3467_3467"></a><a href="#Footnote_3467_3467" class="fnanchor">3467</a> colour, each
of them, in its own way, a stone of high repute. Nay, even
more than this, there are books in existence, the authors of
which I forbear to name,<a id="FNanchor_3468_3468"></a><a href="#Footnote_3468_3468" class="fnanchor">3468</a> which give instructions how to stain
crystal in such a way as to imitate smaragdus and other transparent
stones, how to make sardonyx of sarda, and other
gems in a similar manner. Indeed, there is no kind of fraud
practised, by which larger profits are made.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXXVII_CHAP_76"><span class="inblk">
CHAP. 76. (13.)‚ÄîTHE METHODS OF TESTING PRECIOUS STONES.</span></h3></div>

<p>On the contrary, we will make it our business to point out
the methods of detecting these false stones, seeing that it is
only proper to put luxury even on its guard against fraud.
In addition to the particulars which we have already given,
when treating of each individual kind of precious stone, it is
generally agreed that transparent stones should be tested by
a morning light, or even, if necessary, so late as the fourth<a id="FNanchor_3469_3469"></a><a href="#Footnote_3469_3469" class="fnanchor">3469</a>
hour, but never after that hour. The modes of testing<a id="FNanchor_3470_3470"></a><a href="#Footnote_3470_3470" class="fnanchor">3470</a> stones
are numerous: first, by their weight, the genuine stone being
the heavier of the two; next, by their comparative coolness,
the genuine stone being cooler than the other to the mouth;
and, next to that, by their substance; there being blisters perceptible
in the body of the fictitious stone, as well as a certain
roughness on the surface; filaments, too, an unequal brilliancy,
and a brightness that falls short before it reaches the eye.
The best<a id="FNanchor_3471_3471"></a><a href="#Footnote_3471_3471" class="fnanchor">3471</a> mode of testing is to strike off a fragment with
an iron saw; but this is a thing not allowed by the
dealers, who equally refuse to let their gems be tested by the
file. Dust of Obsian<a id="FNanchor_3472_3472"></a><a href="#Footnote_3472_3472" class="fnanchor">3472</a> stone will not leave a mark upon the
surface of a genuine stone: but where the gem is artificial,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464">464</a></span>every mark that is made will leave a white scratch upon it.
In addition to this, there is such a vast diversity in their degrees
of hardness, that some stones do not admit of being
engraved with iron, and others can only be cut with a graver
blunted at the edge. In all cases, however, precious stones
may be cut and polished by the aid of adamas<a id="FNanchor_3473_3473"></a><a href="#Footnote_3473_3473" class="fnanchor">3473</a> an operation
which may be considerably expedited by heating the graver.
The rivers which produce precious stones, are the Acesinus<a id="FNanchor_3474_3474"></a><a href="#Footnote_3474_3474" class="fnanchor">3474</a>
and the Ganges; and, of all countries, India is the most prolific
of them.</p>

CHAP. 77.‚ÄîA COMPARATIVE VIEW OF NATURE AS SHE APPEARS IN
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE COMPARATIVE VALUES OF THINGS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Having now treated of all the works of Nature, it will be
as well to take a sort of comparative view of her several productions,
as well as the countries which supply them. Throughout
the whole earth, then, and wherever the vault of heaven
extends, there is no country so beautiful, or which, for the productions
of Nature, merits so high a rank as Italy, that ruler
and second parent of the world; recommended as she is by
her men, her women, her generals, her soldiers, her slaves,
her superiority in the arts, and the illustrious examples of
genius which she has produced. Her situation, too, is equally
in her favour; the salubrity and mildness of her climate; the
easy access which she offers to all nations; her coasts indented
with so many harbours; the propitious breezes, too, that always
prevail on her shores; advantages, all of them, due to her situation,
lying, as she does, midway between the East and the West,
and extended in the most favourable of all positions. Add to
this, the abundant supply of her waters, the salubrity of her
groves, the repeated intersections of her mountain ranges, the
comparative innocuousness of her wild animals, the fertility of
her soil, and the singular richness of her pastures.</p>

<p>Whatever there is that the life of man ought not to feel in
want of, is nowhere to be found in greater perfection than
here; the cereals, for example, wine, oil, wool, flax, tissues,
and oxen. As to horses, there are none, I find, preferred to
those of Italy for the course;<a id="FNanchor_3475_3475"></a><a href="#Footnote_3475_3475" class="fnanchor">3475</a> while, for mines of gold, silver,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">465</a></span>copper, and iron, so long as it was deemed lawful to work
them,<a id="FNanchor_3476_3476"></a><a href="#Footnote_3476_3476" class="fnanchor">3476</a> Italy was held inferior to no country whatsoever. At
the present day, teeming as she is with these treasures, she
contents herself with lavishing upon us, as the whole of her
bounties, her various liquids, and the numerous flavours yielded
by her cereals and her fruits. Next to Italy, if we except the
fabulous regions of India, I would rank Spain, for my own
part, those districts, at least, that lie in the vicinity of the sea.<a id="FNanchor_3477_3477"></a><a href="#Footnote_3477_3477" class="fnanchor">3477</a>
She is parched and sterile in one part, it is true; but where
she is at all productive, she yields the cereals in abundance,
oil, wine, horses, and metals of every kind. In all these respects,
Gaul is her equal, no doubt; but Spain, on the other
hand, outdoes the Gallic provinces in her spartum<a id="FNanchor_3478_3478"></a><a href="#Footnote_3478_3478" class="fnanchor">3478</a> and her
specular stone,<a id="FNanchor_3479_3479"></a><a href="#Footnote_3479_3479" class="fnanchor">3479</a> the products of her desert tracts, in her pigments
that minister to our luxuries, in the ardour displayed by
her people in laborious employments, in the perfect training
of her slaves, in the robustness of body of her men, and in
their general resoluteness of character.</p>

<p>As to the productions themselves, the greatest value of
all, among the products of the sea, is attached to pearls:
of objects that lie upon the surface of the earth, it is crystals
that are most highly esteemed: and of those derived from
the interior, adamas,<a id="FNanchor_3480_3480"></a><a href="#Footnote_3480_3480" class="fnanchor">3480</a> smaragdus,<a id="FNanchor_3481_3481"></a><a href="#Footnote_3481_3481" class="fnanchor">3481</a> precious stones, and murrhine,<a id="FNanchor_3482_3482"></a><a href="#Footnote_3482_3482" class="fnanchor">3482</a>
are the things upon which the highest value is placed.
The most costly things that are matured by the earth, are
the kermes-berry<a id="FNanchor_3483_3483"></a><a href="#Footnote_3483_3483" class="fnanchor">3483</a> and laser;<a id="FNanchor_3484_3484"></a><a href="#Footnote_3484_3484" class="fnanchor">3484</a> that are gathered from trees,
nard<a id="FNanchor_3485_3485"></a><a href="#Footnote_3485_3485" class="fnanchor">3485</a> and Seric tissues;<a id="FNanchor_3486_3486"></a><a href="#Footnote_3486_3486" class="fnanchor">3486</a> that are derived from the trunks of

and the grease that is derived from the geese of Commagene,<a id="FNanchor_3499_3499"></a><a href="#Footnote_3499_3499" class="fnanchor">3499</a>
I find no remarkable product mentioned. We must
not omit, too, to observe, that gold, for which there is such a
mania with all mankind, hardly holds the tenth rank as an
object of value, and silver, with which we purchase gold,
hardly the twentieth!</p>

that we are enabled to avail ourselves of the new readings of the Bamberg
MS., which has been so admirably collated by M. Ian. In a vast number
of passages previously looked upon as hopelessly corrupt, or else not at all
suspected of being in a mutilated state, this MS. supplies words and clauses,
the existence of which in the original was hitherto unknown; indeed by its
aid the indefatigable Sillig has been enabled, if we may be allowed the
term, almost to <em>rewrite</em> the last six Books of Pliny. From a perusal of
these new readings, as Dr. Smith has justly remarked, we have reason to
infer ‚Äúthat the text of the earlier Books is still in a very defective state,

Sillig is of opinion that Pliny is here alluding to the reason given by Ateius
Capito (quoted in Macrobius, Saturn. B. vii. c. 13), for wearing the ring
on the left hand. It was so worn, he says, from an apprehension that
the precious stone with which it was set, might receive injury from the
continual use made of the right hand.</p></div>

knights whom Romulus established as a body-guard. Their name, probably,
was derived from the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Œ∫·Ω≥ŒªŒ∑œÇ</span>, a ‚Äúwar-horse,‚Äù or ‚Äúcharger,‚Äù
and the body consisted, no doubt, of the patricians in general, or such of
them as could keep horses. Another origin assigned to the appellation is
‚ÄúCeler,‚Äù the name of a chieftain, who was a favourite of Romulus. The
adjective ‚Äúceler,‚Äù ‚Äúswift,‚Äù owes its origin, probably, to the title of these
horsemen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_811_811"></a><a href="#FNanchor_811_811"><span class="label">811</span></a> As, originally, there were 288 ‚Äúscripula,‚Äù or scruples, to the ‚Äúlibra‚Äù or
pound, this would appear to give 5760 sestertii to the pound of gold, and
not 900 merely. Though this apparent discrepancy has generally puzzled
the commentators, the solution, as suggested by M. Parisot, in the Notes
to Ajasson‚Äôs Translation, appears equally simple and satisfactory. He
suggests that in the ‚Äúas,‚Äù or ‚Äúlibra,‚Äù of <em>two ounces</em>, there were 288
scruples. Now, the scruple remaining the same, when the as or libra was
reduced to one ounce, it would contain but 144 of these scruples. Then,
on making the as the sixteenth part of a denarius instead of the tenth, it
would lose three-eighths of its value in scruples, or in other words, 54
scruples, thus making it worth but 90 scruples. Then again, as above
stated, by the Papirian Law, the weight or value of the libra or as was
reduced one-half, making its value in scruples only 45; or, in other words,
five thirty-seconds of its original value, when worth two unci√¶ or ounces.
This number of scruples to the libra would give, at the rate of twenty
sesterces to the scruple of gold, exactly 900 sesterces to the libra of gold.</p></div>

this Book. Beckmann has the following remarks on the present passage:
‚ÄúThat gold-leaf was affixed to metals by means of quicksilver, with the assistance
of heat, in the time of Pliny, we are told by himself in more passages
than one. The metal to be gilded was prepared by salts of every kind,
and rubbed with pumice-stone in order to clean it thoroughly (see Chapter
20), and to render the surface a little rough. This process is similar to
that used at present for gilding with amalgam, by means of heat, especially
as amalgamation was known to the ancients. But, to speak the truth,
Pliny says nothing of heating the metal <em>after</em> the gold is applied, or of
evaporating the quicksilver, but of drying the cleaned metal before the
gold is laid on. Had he not mentioned quicksilver, his gilding might
have been considered as that with gold leaf by means of heat, <em>dorure en
feuille √† feu</em>, in which the gold is laid upon the metal after it has been
cleaned and heated, and strongly rubbed with blood-stone, or polished steel.
Felibien (<cite>Principes de l‚ÄôArchitecture.</cite> Paris, 1676, p. 280) was undoubtedly
right when he regretted that the process of the ancients, the excellence
of which is proved by remains of antiquity, has been lost.‚Äù‚ÄîHist. Inv.
Vol. II. pp. 294, 295. <cite>Bohn‚Äôs Edition.</cite></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_971_971"></a><a href="#FNanchor_971_971"><span class="label">971</span></a> Beckmann finds considerable difficulties in this description‚Äî‚ÄúI acknowledge
that this passage I do not fully comprehend. It seems to say
that the quicksilver, when the gold was laid on too thin, appeared through
it, but that this might be prevented by mixing with the quicksilver the
white of an egg. The quicksilver then remained under the gold: a thing
which is impossible. When the smallest drop of quicksilver falls upon
gilding, it corrodes the noble metal, and produces an empty spot. It is,
therefore, incomprehensible to me how this could be prevented by using
the white of an egg. Did Pliny himself completely understand gilding?
Perhaps he only meant to say that many artists gave out the cold-gilding,
where the gold-leaf was laid on with the white of an egg, as gilding by
means of heat.‚Äù‚ÄîHist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 295.</p></div>

a passage in the Mostellaria of Plautus, A. 1, S. 3, l. 101, where they are
distinctly mentioned. To reconcile this contradiction, Meursius remarks
that Pliny speaks only of his countrymen, and not of the Greeks, who had
such articles much earlier, though the scene in Plautus is at Athens.‚Äù‚ÄîBeckmann,

aversis.‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúOf what Pliny says here I can give no explanation. Hardouin
(qy. if not Dalechamps?) is of opinion that mirrors, according to the
newest invention, at that period were covered behind with a plate of gold,
as our mirrors are with an amalgam. But as the ancient plates of silver
were not transparent, how could the gold at the back of them produce any
effect in regard to the image? May not the meaning be that a thin plate
of gold was placed at some distance before the mirror, in order to throw
more light upon its surface? Whatever may have been the case, Pliny
himself seems not to have had much confidence in the invention.‚Äù‚ÄîBeckmann,

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_1054_1054"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1054_1054"><span class="label">1054</span></a> Dr. Watson (Chemical Essays, Vol. IV. p. 246) seems to think that
Pliny is here speaking of <em>glass</em> mirrors: ‚ÄúIf we admit that Pliny was
acquainted with glass mirrors, we may thus understand what he says
respecting an invention which was then new, of applying gold behind a
mirror. Instead of an amalgam of tin, some one had proposed to cover
the back of the mirror with an amalgam of gold, with which the ancients
were certainly acquainted, and which they employed in gilding.‚Äù See
Chapter <a href="#BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_20">20</a> of the present Book. On the above passage by Dr. Watson,
Beckmann has the following remarks: ‚ÄúThis conjecture appears, at any
rate, to be ingenious; but when I read the passage again, without prejudice,
I can hardly believe that Pliny alludes to a plate of glass in a place
where he speaks only of metallic mirrors; and the overlaying with amalgam
requires too much art to allow me to ascribe it to such a period without
sufficient proof. I consider it more probable, that some person had
tried, by means of a polished plate of gold, to collect the rays of light, and
to throw them either on the mirror or the object, in order to render the
image brighter.‚Äù‚ÄîHist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 72.</p></div>

seems to imply that the productions in question, all of which perished,
were the <em>only</em> works executed by this artist; but we find several passages
of ancient writers, in which vases, &amp;c. engraved by Mentor, are mentioned
as extant. Thus, then, we must conclude, either that the term ‚Äòomnino‚Äô
should be understood in the sense of ‚Äòchiefly,‚Äô ‚Äòpre-eminently,‚Äô or that the
individuals claiming to possess works of Mentor, were themselves misinformed,
or endeavoured to deceive others.‚Äù If, however, we look at the
word ‚Äúparia‚Äù in a strictly technical sense, the difficulty will probably be
removed. Pliny‚Äôs meaning seems to be that Mentor made four <em>pairs</em>, and
no more, of some peculiar kind of vessel probably, and that all these
pairs were now lost. He does not say that Mentor did not make other
works of art, in <em>single</em> pieces. Thiersch, <cite>Act. Acad. Monac.</cite> v. p. 128, expresses
an opinion that the word ‚Äúomnino‚Äù is a corruption, and that in
it lies concealed the name of the kind of plate that is meant.</p></div>

passage of Pliny in which Lehmann thinks he can with certainty discover
cobalt, is so singular a medley that nothing to be depended on can be
gathered from it. The author, it is true, where he treats of mineral pigments,
seems to speak of a blue sand which produced different shades of
blue paint, according as it was pounded coarser or finer. The palest powder
was called lomentum, and this Lehmann considers as our powder-blue. I
am, however, fully convinced that the <em>cyanus</em> of Theophrastus, the <em>c√¶ruleum</em>
of Pliny, and the <em>chrysocolla</em> (see Chapter <a href="#BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_26">26</a>), were the blue copper earth

here, <em>usus ad fenestras</em>, has been misapplied by Lehmann, as a strong proof

was used for painting window-frames; but glass windows were at
that time unknown. I suspect that Pliny meant to say only that one
kind of paint could not be employed near openings which afforded a
passage to the light, as it soon decayed and lost its colour. This would
have been the case in particular with <em>lake</em>, in which there was a mixture of

behind him twenty-one orations. We learn from Cicero and Quintilian
that his compositions were carefully moulded after the models of the Attic
school, but were deficient in ease and freshness. As a poet he was the
author of many short pieces, equally remarkable for their looseness and
elegance. He wrote also some severe lampoons on Pompey and C√¶sar,

were the Roman numerals for the figures in question. We are informed
that some MSS. of Pliny give the number three hundred and fifty-five only,
and there is reason to believe that, in the time of Numa, this was considered
to be the actual number of days in the year. Some of the commentators,
however, are disposed to read three hundred and sixty-five; and this opinion
derives some support from Macrobius, who refers to this statue as indicating
this latter number with its fingers.‚ÄîB. The Bamberg MS. gives three

in reference to this passage:‚Äî‚ÄúIn my opinion, this was the name
given to pieces of steel completely manufactured and brought to that state
which rendered them fit for commerce. At present steel comes from
Biscay in cakes, from other places in bars, and both these were formerly
called ‚Äòstrictur√¶,‚Äô because they were employed chiefly for giving sharpness
to instruments, or tools, that is, for steeling them. In speaking of other
metals, Pliny says that the finished productions at the works were not called
‚Äòstrictur√¶‚Äô (the case, for example, with copper), though sharpness could
be given to instruments with other metals also. The words of Pliny just
quoted are read different ways, and still remain obscure. I conjecture
that he meant to say, that some steel-works produced things which were
entirely of steel, and that others were employed only in steeling‚Äî‚Äòad
densandas incudes malleorumve rostra.‚Äô I shall here remark that these ‚Äòstrictur√¶ ferri‚Äô remind us of the
‚Äòstriges auri,‚Äô (see B. xxxiii. c. <a href="#BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_19">19</a>),
such being the name given to native pieces of gold, which, without being

that unprincipled artists employed tin mixed with lead. It is most
probable, however, that Pliny himself has made a mistake, and that we
should read ‚Äúequal parts of black lead‚Äù (our lead); in which case the

but more especially encaustic colours, which were probably kept dry
in boxes, and the wet brush or pencil was rubbed upon them when colour
was required, or they were moistened by the artist previous to commencing
work. From the term ‚Äòcer√¶‚Äô it would appear that wax constituted the
principal ingredient in the colouring vehicle used; but this does not necessarily
follow, and it is very improbable that it did; there must have
been a great portion of gum or resin in the colours, or they could not have
hardened. Wax was undoubtedly a most essential ingredient, since it
apparently prevents the colours from cracking. ‚ÄòCer√¶‚Äô therefore might
originally simply mean colours which contained wax, in contradistinction

(Brutus, c. 18), which, however, quite contradicts the statement of Pliny.
‚ÄúIn painting, we admire in the works of Zeuxis, Polygnotus, Timanthes,
and those who used <em>four</em> colours only, the figure and the lineaments; but
in the works of Echion, Nicomachus, Protogenes, and Apelles, <em>everything</em>
is perfect.‚Äù Indeed Pliny contradicts himself, for he speaks of <em>two</em> other
colours used by the earliest painters, the <em>testa trita</em>, or ground earthenware,
in Chapter <a href="#BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_5">5</a> of this Book; and ‚Äúcinnabaris,‚Äù or vermilion, in B. xxxiii.
c. <a href="#BOOK_XXXIII_CHAP_35">36</a>. Also, in Chapter <a href="#BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_21">21</a> of this Book he speaks of Eretrian earth as
having been used by Nicomachus, and in Chapter <a href="#BOOK_XXXV_CHAP_25">25</a> of ivory black as
having been invented by Apelles.</p></div>

means to say that such colossal figures were till then unknown in painting,
or whether that the use of canvass in painting was till then unknown.
If the latter is the meaning, it is not exactly correct, though it is probable
that the introduction of canvass for this purpose was comparatively late;
there being no mention of its being employed by the Greek painters of the
best periods.</p></div>

sexual distinction that is here alluded to. Eumarus, perhaps, may have been
the first to give to each sex its characteristic style of design, in the compositions,
draperies, attitudes, and complexions of the respective sexes.
Wornum thinks that, probably, Eumarus, and certainly, Cimon, belonged
to the class of ancient tetrachromists, or polychromists, painting in a variety
of colours, without a due, or at least a partial, observance of the
laws of light and shade. Smith‚Äôs Dict. Antiq. Art. <cite>Painting</cite>.</p></div>

about the 80th Olympiad. It is probable, however, that he lived
long before the age of Polygnotus; but some time after that of Eumarus.
Wornum thinks that he was probably a contemporary of Solon, a century
before Polygnotus.</p></div>

It is not improbable that he became a citizen of Athens in the seventy-ninth

As Pliny has already stated that Polygnotus flourished <em>before</em> the ninetieth
Olympiad, there is an inconsistency in his making mention of the son as
flourishing before the father. Hence Sillig, with B√∂ttiger, is inclined to
think that there were two artists of this name, one about the seventieth,
and the other about the ninetieth Olympiad, the former being the father
of Polygnotus.</p></div>

draped in a garment, which, while it seemed designed to hide the

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_2387_2387"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2387_2387"><span class="label">2387</span></a> The ancient writers abound in praises of this wonderful statue.
Lucian, however, has given the most complete and artistic description of
it. It was supposed by the ancients, to represent Venus as standing before
Paris, when he awarded to her the prize of beauty; but it has been
well remarked, that the drapery in the right hand, and the vase by the
side of the figure, indicate that she has either just left or is about to enter
the bath. The artist modelled it from Phryne, a courtesan or het√¶ra of
Athens, of whom he was greatly enamoured. It was ultimately carried
to Constantinople, where it perished by fire in the reign of Justinian. It
is doubtful whether there are any copies of it in existence. There is,
however, a so-called copy in the gardens of the Vatican, and another in
the Glyptothek, at Munich. A Venus in the Museo Pio-Clementino, at
Rome, is considered by Visconti and others to have been a copy of the
Cnidian Venus, with the addition of drapery. It is supposed that Cleomenes,
in making the Venus de Medici, imitated the Cnidian Venus in
some degree.</p></div>

The account given by Pliny is very confused, and Littr√© has taken some
pains to explain the construction of this building. He is of opinion that
in the first place, a quadrangular main building was erected, 63 feet in
length on the north and south, the breadth of the east and west faces
being shorter, some 42 feet perhaps. Secondly, that there was a screen of
36 columns surrounding the main building, and 411 feet in circumference.
(He adopts this reading in preference to the 440 feet of the Bamberg MS.)
That the longer sides of this screen were 113.25 feet in extent, and the
shorter 92.125 feet. That between the main building and this screen, or
colonnade, there was an interval of 25.125 feet. Thirdly, that the colonnade
and the main buildings were united by a vaulted roof, and that this
union formed the ‚ÄúPteron.‚Äù Fourthly, that rising from this Pteron,
there was a quadrangular truncated pyramid, formed of twenty-four steps,
and surmounted with a chariot of marble. This would allow, speaking in
round numbers, 37&frac12; feet for the height of the main body of the building,
37&frac12; feet for the pyramid, and twenty-five feet for the height of the chariot
and the figure which it doubtless contained.</p></div>

but, as may be discovered from an attentive examination of the
present passage, Lessing and Thiersch are probably right in considering
them to have been contemporaries of the Emperor Titus. This group is
generally supposed to have been identical with the Laoco√∂n still to be seen
in the Court of the Belvedere, in the Vatican at Rome; having been
found, in 1506, in a vault beneath the spot known as the Place <em>de Sette
Sale</em>, by Felix de Fredi, who surrendered it, in consideration of a pension,
to Pope Julius II. The group, however, is not made of a <em>single</em> block,
which has caused some to doubt its identity: but it is not improbable, that
when originally made, its joints were not perceptible to a common observer.
The spot, too, where it was found was actually part of the palace
of Titus. It is most probable that the artists had the beautiful episode
of Laoco√∂n in view, as penned by Virgil, √Ün. B. II.; though Ajasson
doubts whether they derived any inspiration from it. Laoco√∂n, in the

the statue still to be seen at Medinet Abou, on the Libyan side of

arms, and other parts of the body are covered with inscriptions, which
attest that, in the third century of the Christian era, the priests still practised

sounds. It may possibly have been erected for astronomical purposes, or

Polycrates.‚ÄîThe stone is of considerable size, and oblong in form. The
engraving on it, by Theodore of Samos, the son of Talikles, is of extraordinary
fineness and beauty. It represents a lyre, with three bees flying
about; below, on the right, a dolphin; on the left, the head of a bull.
The name of the engraver is inscribed in Greek characters. The upper
surface of the stone is slightly concave, not highly polished, and one
corner broken. It is asserted that the possessor has been offered 50,000
dollars for it.‚Äù</p></div>

differing much in their physical properties. A few of these are quartz,
specular iron ore, emery, and other substances of rather high degrees of

(footnote numbers in the original are clothed thus [99].)
Footnote 1794 [8], p. 224. The reference to Note [18], p. 196 appears to be incorrect.<br />
Footnote 3398 [13], p. 456. See Chapter 56, Note 3241 [55] should read See Chapter 55, Note 3241 [55].</p>

<p class="noindent">In footnote 24 ‚ÄúSee Introduction to Vol. III.‚Äù probably refers to the
glossary of ‚ÄúGREEK AND ROMAN MONEY, WEIGHTS, AND MEASURES MENTIONED BY

Similarly,<br />
Agrippa, M. vi. 480 is incorrect.</p>
<p class="noindent">Hyophthalmos, vi. 459.<br />
